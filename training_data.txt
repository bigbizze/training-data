<|startoftext|>Spherical zones of various colors surround the planet. You take out your equipment and try to judge which direction you need to head in from here.
You exhale, step off the airship, and fall through a sea of purple mist. When you open your eyes, you see a brown planet with vast jungles below.
The light energy available from the impossible to forget blue supergiant star has led to most of the foliage and plants in this jungle having a blue colour.

Your sensors wake you as they've discovered a harsh planet that barely meets your criteria. Your sensors inform you that it is the fourth moon of a gas giant of a blue hyper-giant main sequence star..
The planet below you appears to be covered in dense Jungle and looks like a healthy and fortified world.
< Choose moon for your quest or find a new solar system?

You decide to Visit this moon.
As your ship enters the planet's atmosphere, you can see a large area of the Jungle that is dominated by blue rivers, mostly made of water.
The planet is extremely life-sustaining and must have an extensive eco-system.
Although, many of the intelligent animals are violent and tend to attack other creatures on sight.
Your ship finds a clearing at the edge of the river systems and the jungle.
< Do you want to explore the river systems or explore the jungle?
> Explore the river systems
The river is one of the largest you've ever seen, perhaps with a width of twenty meters and a depth of eight meters. You almost get the urge to go for a swim.
Although, there are more important matters at hand.
There is strange, rich vegetation along the river and thick, dense Jungle otherwise. However, the ground is relatively flat and clear of large trees and plants.
The water of the river you're following has reacted strangely with your sensors; it is picking up an minor life-form reading but you can't see what it is detecting.
The river next to you parts and a Discomon emerges from the depths.
It rides the wake it created to the shore and lands in front of you ready for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You travel along the river and find a rather large stack of uprooted trees floating in one of the channels.
Intrigued, you order your ship to land on top of the flotilla so you can go out and investigate.
The other channel contains fractured tree trunks and branches.
You make a note of this, so you know not to go too far right or left of the rivers when travelling around it later.
A Discomon challenges you to a battle in the same fashion as the last one did!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You continue onwards, without coming across much of note for quite a while.
Eventually you notice a bright blue light shining in the river next to you.
Your sensors cannot identify what it is beyond it being an orb of some kind.
It appears to be emitting only emitting waves in the blue part of the visible light spectrum.
You cannot be sure if it is safe to interact with.
< Do you want to interact with the blue orb or ignore it?

You ignore the orb and continue on your quest.

Its report paints the picture of a world of vast yellow deserts, separated by volcanically active mountains.
It plots a good landing spots for both a volcano to the North and sand deserts to the South.
< Do you want to visit the volcanoes or the sand desert?

You land your ship at the base of the volcano. You identify the entrance to a cave system around the volcano. The entrance has no loose rock or debris around it.
The ground here is solid stone: no ash, no loose gravel but is instead as hard as pavement.
You enter the cave system, and your exo-suit informs you that you cannot survive in temperatures this hot forever.
You continue deeper into the cave system.
You round a corner and find yourself staring at a majestic sight: in the middle of the cave is a large underground lake of boiling water. Its heat warms your face, despite being inside the cave.
It is not steam that makes the air hazy, but the scorching lava below.

Your first stop is a a suitable location in a dying solar system being consumed by a black hole. This moon is the only place life has been discovered, and it is unique in that the entire solar system is slowly shifting out of existence.,
You are unsure how long you have until it disappears entirely, so you are determined to make the most of your trip.,
As you approach the moon you can't help but notice it's purple colour and arcane vibe,
It's strange to see something so purple and magical in a sea of black holes, dying stars, and white dwarf remnants.,
This moon is definitely a sight to see.
< Visit this planet or find a new solar system?
> Investigate planet
The moon is more colorful and vibrant than you've seen in a while. There are trees, plants, flowers, and purple mountains that curve upward instead of downward like you're used to.
The mountains lay to your West, and border on their East what appears to be a crystal forest which gives off an animated teal coloured glow.
< Head West to the mountains or head Northeast towards the crystal forest?
> Head Northeast towards the crystal forest
You head towards the crystal forest.
Something about this purple moon's juxtaposition against this teal crystal forest has drawn you here and you can't quite put your finger on what it is.
You begin to hear a strange sort of music in the distance, and you've never heard anything quite like it.
The music is unlike anything you've ever heard before... and yet it feels so strangely familiar...
You were distracted and did not notice the highly animated Discomon sneaking up on you looking for a battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
After winning you feel compelled by the animation of the things around you to continue further into the forest.
The trees begin to look stranger and stranger the deeper you go, and soon you seem to start to see the crystals take on a life of their own.
Suddenly a teal Discomon bursts from within the crystal next to you and you are forced to battle it!

As the opposing Discomon begins to fade away, the lava recedes, presenting you with a path forward through the caves.
You arrive at a thick, basaltic door.
You open it and find yourself on a lookout carved into the volcano. It is night, and you are breath-taking views of the stars above.
As you turn around to re-enter the caves, you come face to face with a Discomon standing in your way!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!

You defeat the Discomon and re-enter the cave system to continue your quest.
You continue deeper into the cave system, and stumble upon a large spherical area.
The walls are smooth, almost as if they were man-made. There is a machine protruding from the ground in the centre of the room, with an irregularly shaped hole in the middle.

A huge wall of dense clouds sits in an ever-present eastern direction of your trajectory.
As you approach, you notice an ancient city spanning thousands of miles to the North of your chosen landing spot on the ocean.
You exit your ship and begin to walk on the water towards the animated ancient city. The surface tension of water like this is what your exo-suit's boots were designed for.

You decide to Choose moon for your quest. As you descend through the planet's thick nitrogen atmosphere, you notice that it is also dotted with interesting yellow geography.
You land your ship in a clearing near the equator. Your ship's readout tells you that there are blue rivers of water to your East and cracked salt flats to your Southeast.
< Do you want to head East or Southeast?
> Head Southeast
You head Southeast towards the salt flats. You can smell the salt in the air through your air ventilation as the air is nearly breathable.
Your can hear the crackle of your feet crushing the fragile salt footing beneath them. Your sensors tell you that this is likely Magnesium Sulfate.
Suddenly, the sand next to you begins to shake! A Discomon pushes its way upwards through the sand looking for a battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon
> Battle the Discomon and win
You regain yourself after the battle and ask yourself if you should continue.
< Do you want to continue on this path or head home?
> Continue on this path
You continue deeper on your path into the salt flats. You start to grow weary of the oppressive heat your suit is working so hard to prevent you from noticing.
The yellowish scenery here and the blue star illuminating it create a purplish horizon that seems to extend forever.
You scan the area with your suit's sensors but find no trace of anything living. However, you do find a hole in the ground nearby and decide to investigate it.
You shine a flashlight down the hole but see nothing but darkness. You shine your headlamp further in but can't see the bottom.
Dismayed by your useless foray into digging, you look up to continue on, but as you do so, your eyes meet the gaze of a Discomon staring at you menacingly and prepared for a battle.
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon
> Battle the Discomon and win
You ensure your Discomon are okay and then wonder if it's time to head home.
< Do you want to continue on this path or head home?

< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You win your battle with the Discomon and ask yourself if you've done all you need to.
< Do you want to continue on this path or head home?
> Continue on this path
You continue still deeper into the salt flats, growing slightly more tired as your quest progresses. The landscape here is truly desolate, with only small patches of life hidden away amidst the sand and rocks. This world seems to consist almost entirely of salt, sand, and rocks.
Suddenly, you hear a growl and turn around to find that a Discomon has snuck up behind you!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Continue on this path
You recalibrate yourself with your ship, and continue further into this desolate world. You are starting to feel quite exhausted. The sun here seems to be much more unforgiving than it did on your home planet.
You don't know how or why that is, but it feels as though you've been walking on this path for days. You take a water break, and decide to scan the area before continuing on.
Your suit's sensors pick up a shambling mass of lifeforms wandering the area nearby. You don't know what they are, but you get the impression that they're moving this way.
< Do you want to investigate the lifeforms or runaway?
> Runaway
You run away from the life-form and seem to escape safely. You might still be able to salvage your quest.
You continue onward passing through strange yellow plains of sand until you begin to notice tall sand structures rising out of the ground near the horizon.
The tallest and closest is easy to access, but the closer you get the less stable it seems.
< You see something glimmer at the top however, and need to decide if you should continue climbing or take a different path.
> Continue climbing
You climb and you climb until your knuckles bleed, but you push on.
The golden figure that once sat atop the spire has been worn down by centuries of sandstorms.
You see at the summit a large amount of Zeal essence, but your finger slips.
You manage to hang on with one foot and one hand.
< Swing body around the side and go for a better grip or lunge for essence?
> Go for a better grip
You swing your body around the side and regain your grip on the spire. It's very steep as it tapers upward and you know if you fall, your quest will be over.
You feel your grip losing friction, but you're able to stabilize the rest of your climb. Eventually, you manage to reach the top of the spire and can peer down at the lifeless desert below.
You collect your essence and head home.
> Head home after successful quest
This was a productive quest. You signal to your ship that you want to leave.
> Receive essence and end quest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship accelerates in reverse gradually over half a lightyear to save energy and reduce your cryosleep sickness.
You enter the orbit of the fourth moon of a gas giant of a blue hyper-giant main sequence star. This is a harsh planet that barely meets your criteria..
The planet below you appears to be covered in dense Jungle and looks like a healthy and fortified world.
< Choose moon for your quest or find a new solar system?
> Visit this moon
You decide to Visit this moon.
As your ship enters the planet's atmosphere, you can see a large area of the Jungle that is dominated by blue rivers, mostly made of water.
The planet is extremely life-sustaining and must have an extensive eco-system.
Although, many of the intelligent animals are violent and tend to attack other creatures on sight.
Your ship finds a clearing at the edge of the river systems and the jungle.
< Do you want to explore the river systems or explore the jungle?
> Explore the river systems
The river is one of the largest you've ever seen, perhaps with a width of twenty meters and a depth of eight meters. You almost get the urge to go for a swim.
Although, there are more important matters at hand.
There is strange, rich vegetation along the river and thick, dense Jungle otherwise. However, the ground is relatively flat and clear of large trees and plants.
The water of the river you're following has reacted strangely with your sensors; it is picking up an minor life-form reading but you can't see what it is detecting.
The river next to you parts and a Discomon emerges from the depths.
It rides the wake it created to the shore and lands in front of you ready for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You travel along the river and find a rather large stack of uprooted trees floating in one of the channels.
Intrigued, you order your ship to land on top of the flotilla so you can go out and investigate.
The other channel contains fractured tree trunks and branches.
You make a note of this, so you know not to go too far right or left of the rivers when travelling around it later.
A Discomon challenges you to a battle in the same fashion as the last one did!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You continue onwards, without coming across much of note for quite a while.
Eventually you notice a bright blue light shining in the river next to you.
Your sensors cannot identify what it is beyond it being an orb of some kind.
It appears to be emitting only emitting waves in the blue part of the visible light spectrum.
You cannot be sure if it is safe to interact with.
< Do you want to interact with the blue orb or ignore it?
> Interact with it
You interact with the blue orb and it grows brighter and warmer.
You pick it up and are about to throw it away from you when it explodes!
You are overwhelmed by the bright flash of light. The last thing you remember are your sensors warning you about an overload of gamma-rays.
> Battle the Discomon and lose
...What happened??
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship's AI wakes you up from cryosleep as you've entered the orbit of the fourth moon of a gas giant of a neutron star solar system..
The planet below you has a brilliant red colour to it and your sensors inform you that it's likely to be too hot to survive in normal conditions. Luckily, however, your exo-suit should be able to handle it for a long period of time.
There's a strong source of geothermal energy below as well as possible non-sentient life and your quest is to recover an essence of this world for preservation.
Your sensors inform you that the geothermal energy is a by-product of neutronium refinement. Neutronium is invaluable for the construction of starships that must endure unregulated hyperspace.
< Investigate moon or find a new solar system?
> Explore moon
The hot springs glow with a red aura to them. You also see a strange structures on the surface of the moon. It appears as if they are of unnatural construction & likely ancient.
You find a small clearing in the hot springs and land your ship. You find a small clearing in the hot springs and land your ship. Exiting your ship, you see that the ground here is too warm and your heat shields are struggling to cope. You can hear a loud roar emanating from somewhere close by.
It's a good thing your hazard suit protects you from the intense heat. You take a look around, don't want to venture too far from the ship in case you need to make a quick escape.
Soon after your advance into the hot spring dotted landscape, a Discomon adapted to withstand the environment rides the plume of a hot spring and prepares for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
Taking a look around, you see an abundance of plant life in every direction. This is augmented by the hot-springs surrounding you. The planet is very humid.
Up ahead is a range of small hills that dot the horizon to your North. Your sensors inform you that the strongest radiation readings it gets are coming from over these hills.
It is likely that the strange structures you noticed on your way down are in this direction.
You likely only have enough time before your exo-suit needs repair to fully investigate the hot springs, or head over these hills.
< Head North towards the small hills or continue exploring the hot springs?
> Continue exploring the hot springs
You decide to continue exploring the hot springs. You walk for hours through the hot springs without much of anything happening.
Their beauty is almost mesmerizing and you feel like you should turn back... but the signs on your suit's energy alarm are becoming more frequent.
Then without warning a Discomon ascends from the boiling water of one of the hot springs and prepares for battle!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the Discomon and collect yourself. Your exo-suit are approaching the danger zone and your sensors inform you that you should really be leaving.
You consider it, but notice a glimmering object just up ahead. It could be essence, but investigating it would be cutting it close for your exo-suit.
You could put your suit into emergency mode, which will elongate the exo-suit's effective lifetime, but this will make you more vulnerable to battle with wild Discomon,
you could risk it and hope you have enough time remaining, or you could just head home.
< Put your suit into emergency mode, risk it and investigate or head home?
> Head home early
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your sensors wake you as they've happened upon an ideal planet for sustaining Discomon. Your sensors inform you that it is the second moon of a gas giant of a red supergiant main sequence star..
Your ship starts to shudder violently, as if caught in an invisible vice. You see an enormous ring made up of solid ice and rock debris, surrounding the planet.
Your ship manages to stabilize itself and it only reports minor damage.
After this is resolved, you notice for the first time that the planet is primarily a vibrant yellow colour.
< Land on moon or find a new solar system?
> Choose moon for your quest
You decide to Choose moon for your quest and descend through the planet's brilliant yellow atmosphere.
At first you're concerned that your ship incorrectly identified this planet as one with solid ground, as it seems to go on forever.
Finally the sulfur clouds part and you get your first view of the ground of this planet.
Lakes of liquid ethane dot the landscape to your Southeast. To your North is what appears to be an endless sea of red sands
< Head Southeast towards the ethane lakes or head North towards the red sands?
> Head Southeast towards the ethane lakes
The atmospheres of the planet is so thick that it is simply impossible to miss what lies below you: huge, bubbling pools of flammable liquid.
You see a wake up ahead and as it nears, you realize that it's a Discomon!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship slows down and wakes you up from cryosleep. You've arrived at the second moon of a gas giant of a vast blue-white supergiant main sequence star solar system..
Your ship's computer displays its findings on a holographic simulation in the bridge.
There is wildlife on this moon, and it radiates a stunning red colour.
< Explore moon or find a new solar system?
> Land on moon
You decide to Land on moon.
You are excited to explore this moon, finally, something is going right! You look at the simulation choose a spot within the electromagnetic field of the gas giant.
There is a bit of a wait for the ship's computer to finish its preparations, but eventually it's ready for you to disembark.
It informs you that this planet is completely barren outside of the blue mountains to your North.
You find it strange that the planet appeared so red from space, but doesn't seem to give off this colour at all at ground level.
You go through the airlock and open up the docking hatch, heading towards the mountains to the North as they are they only apparent destination here.
As you make your journey you are forced to pace yourself; the planet's magnetosphere is much different than the Earth's, meaning that you can't rely on magnetic North to keep you on a straight path.
Instead, you must use a compass. Once you reach the base of the mountains, however, your efforts have proven worthwhile.
You begin to climb the mountain, but before too long you notice that things are beginning to appear more red again.
You look behind you and the barren landscape appears to be almost translucent, as if much of it were actually windows covered in dirt.
< Descend from your climb and see what is below the ground or continue climbing?
> Descend and see what is below ground
You climb back down the mountain and approach the barren land with newfound interest.
Your suit blows the surface material away revealing what you suspected, ceiling windows to some ancient laboratory.
The more you clean off, the more the brilliant critical red light shines through.
You test if the material the roof window was made of will support your weight and you learn that it will.
You cut a circular hole in the window, pushing it through, and attach a clamp to it.
You descend into the ancient laboratory.
Once inside the lab you look around in awe as the entire room is a mess of hundreds of chemistry sets, beakers and burners.
You accidentally knock over a rusting beaker and it smashes on the floor.
The liquid spilled then amazingly reverses entropy and from it materializes a Discomon!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You fist pump in satisfaction for your victory.
You find what you believe to be the databases the ship mentioned and you copy their contents onto a portable drive.
Upon inspection you find schematics which reveal this place to have a number of wings you haven't explored yet.
You head down another corridor...
Your mind races to imagine what the government of the civilization you're looking at could be like... Democracy? Autocracy? Capitalist? Socialist?
You turn a corner and a red hologram of a lifeform appears in front of you.
It warns you that continuing deeper is almost certain demise and insists that you leave now.
< Do you ignore the lifeform and continue into the ancient laboratory or head home?
> Continue into the ancient laboratory
Having risked life and limb to come here you will not go away empty-handed.
You find rows upon rows of metal shelves filled with beakers and burners and Bunsen burners and chemistry sets.
Your mere presence set aflame the entire corner of the building in front of you, clearly whoever last survived this place didn't want anyone to know what they were doing.
You take a beaker and try to read the inscriptions, but the beaker disintegrates in your hands before you can discover what's written on it.
The entire building is coming apart, with bookshelves and desks and red and blue chairs and other furniture arranging themselves into nonsensical ways.
A metal sculpture resembling a snake twists and contorts itself through a series of loops before your eyes.
It then morphs into a Discomon who prepares for battle!

< Head Southeast towards the ethane lakes or head North towards the red sands?
> Head North towards the red sands
You see what appears to be a never-ending dust storm to the North, and decide to approach it carefully.
Unfortunately, as you get closer, the dust storm begins to look more and more like a blood rain. Not able to approach any closer, you sit back and watch as the entire landscape is covered in red.
You wait for the storm to subside and then continue onwards into the red sand desert.
Your ship's sensors start beeping, and you see a new mass in the distance.
This new object speeds up towards you, and as it approaches you realize it's a Discomon!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
The Discomon lie unconscious at your feet.
You fire a grappling hook to the object they were headed towards, and are surprised to see what turns out to be an enormous red sand crystal.
You scan it with your sensors but while doing so it bursts open and a Discomon appears ready to battle!
This one looks just like the last one you defeated and you quickly realize it is the mother of it!

<|startoftext|>Your adventure begins in a dead end of a galaxy unknown to anyone except the most dedicated explorers. The galaxy was small, but brimming with life and potential for adventure.,
Your first stop is a a suitable location in a dying solar system being consumed by a black hole. This moon is the only place life has been discovered, and it is unique in that the entire solar system is slowly shifting out of existence.,
You are unsure how long you have until it disappears entirely, so you are determined to make the most of your trip.,
As you approach the moon you can't help but notice it's purple colour and arcane vibe,
It's strange to see something so purple and magical in a sea of black holes, dying stars, and white dwarf remnants.,
This moon is definitely a sight to see.
< Investigate planet or find a new solar system?
> Explore planet
The moon is more colorful and vibrant than you've seen in a while. There are trees, plants, flowers, and purple mountains that curve upward instead of downward like you're used to.
The mountains lay to your West, and border on their East what appears to be a crystal forest which gives off an animated teal coloured glow.
< Head West to the mountains or head Northeast towards the crystal forest?
> Head Northeast towards the crystal forest
You head towards the crystal forest.
Something about this purple moon's juxtaposition against this teal crystal forest has drawn you here and you can't quite put your finger on what it is.
You begin to hear a strange sort of music in the distance, and you've never heard anything quite like it.
The music is unlike anything you've ever heard before... and yet it feels so strangely familiar...
You were distracted and did not notice the highly animated Discomon sneaking up on you looking for a battle!

<|startoftext|>You enter the orbit of the eighth planet of a white hole. This is a harsh planet that barely meets your criteria..
The planet below you has a distinct purple colour to it.
Your sensors inform you that this is likely because of the white hole at the center of this solar system constantly adding new matter to the system.
< Investigate planet or find a new solar system?

The planet below has a light yellow colour, but the atmosphere is too thick to glean much more than that.
Do you want to investigate this planet or find a new one?
< Explore planet or find a new solar system?
> Land on planet
Not wishing to stay in orbit around a planet you know nothing about, you fly your ship closer to gather additional information.
Your sensors detect significant volcanism in the world below.
Its report paints the picture of a world of vast yellow deserts, separated by volcanically active mountains.
It plots a good landing spots for both a volcano to the North and sand deserts to the South.
< Do you want to visit the volcanoes or the sand desert?
> Visit the volcanoes
You land your ship at the base of the volcano. You identify the entrance to a cave system around the volcano. The entrance has no loose rock or debris around it.
The ground here is solid stone: no ash, no loose gravel but is instead as hard as pavement.
You enter the cave system, and your exo-suit informs you that you cannot survive in temperatures this hot forever.
You continue deeper into the cave system.
You round a corner and find yourself staring at a majestic sight: in the middle of the cave is a large underground lake of boiling water. Its heat warms your face, despite being inside the cave.
It is not steam that makes the air hazy, but the scorching lava below.
A Discomon emerges from the lava critically and lands in front of you, prepare to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You battle the wild Discomon and defeat it.
As the opposing Discomon begins to fade away, the lava recedes, presenting you with a path forward through the caves.
You arrive at a thick, basaltic door.
You open it and find yourself on a lookout carved into the volcano. It is night, and you are breath-taking views of the stars above.
As you turn around to re-enter the caves, you come face to face with a Discomon standing in your way!

As you pass the crest of the hills, a Discomon appears behind some large rocks in front of you and prepares for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the Discomon and continue over the crest of the hill. As soon as you reach the top, you look down on a brilliant ancient city.
This must be what your sensors were picking up on.
The entire ancient city before you emanates a soft glow. It looks almost otherworldly. It seems as if it has been here for eternity.
You take a moment to let the sights and the sounds envelop you. The only sound is the soft trickling of water that passes through the many cracks in the stones on which this city is built upon.
The city appears abandoned, and your sensors inform you that it is highly radioactive. It appears that some ancient civilization did not make it past the nuclear great filter and this city is a testament both to their advanced civilization and their untimely downfall.
Before you move to explore the city, your sensors pick up on a single Discomon wandering around in a pathway through the ruins about half a mile away from you.
< Investigate the Discomon or ignore it and continue into the city?
> Ignore it and continue into the city
You decide to ignore the Discomon and continue deeper into the city.
It appears that someone has already looted this place. All ancient structures and artifacts have been completely stripped.
All that seems to be left are ancient moss and fungus growing among the ruins.
You continue on, but your sensors seem to be detecting an energy reading coming from underground.
It appears to be getting stronger as you approach an old well in the middle of a clearing. The ruins of a stone building encircle the well, which is almost completely caved in.
After looking down the well, your sensors inform you that the depths of the well seem to be less radioactive and descending should allow your quest to continue for longer than it otherwise might have.
< Descend down the well or continue searching the city?
> Descend down the well
You descend down the well, landing on a narrow metal platform that seems to circle downward for hours. After about half an hour of descending, you reach the bottom of the well.
Cubes of metal seem to be embedded into the stone walls on every side. They appear to be emitting the energy that you were detecting earlier.
< Engage the cubes or head through the door at the bottom of the well?
> Head through the door at the bottom of the well
You begin to walk through the corridor of cubes that lead you through to a massive underground room.
A Discomon jumps in front of you, then more and more begin to appear from all sides!

You avoid the tallest of them and your ship rapidly descends to an ideal landing spot.
The steep drop makes you feel queasy.
With some effort, you manage to find an overcome the nausea, exit your ship and take a look around.
Your sensors identify a path forward for you, but they inform you that they are not very certain of what the path contains.
< Should you follow your sensor's path into the crystal forest or head home?
> Follow your sensor's path into the crystal forest
Your sensors detected a much larger concentration of deep space probe markers in this part of the planet.
You begin to follow the markers.
There are markings that indicate a path for you.
You can't help notice a few bones scattered along the path, from smaller life-forms.
Your sensors are picking up markers in front and behind you.
< Do you want to follow the trail or turn back and continue on your ship's path?
> Turn back and continue on your ship's path

The rock is currently unidentifiable.

The river is one of the largest you've ever seen, perhaps with a width of twenty meters and a depth of eight meters. You almost get the urge to go for a swim.
Although, there are more important matters at hand.
There is strange, rich vegetation along the river and thick, dense Jungle otherwise. However, the ground is relatively flat and clear of large trees and plants.
The water of the river you're following has reacted strangely with your sensors; it is picking up an minor life-form reading but you can't see what it is detecting.
The river next to you parts and a Discomon emerges from the depths.
It rides the wake it created to the shore and lands in front of you ready for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spherical zones of various colors surround the planet. You take out your equipment and try to judge which direction you need to head in from here.
You exhale, step off the airship, and fall through a sea of purple mist. When you open your eyes, you see a brown planet with vast jungles below.
The light energy available from the impossible to forget blue supergiant star has led to most of the foliage and plants in this jungle having a blue colour.
< Land on moon or find a new solar system?
> Choose moon for your quest
As you land your ship receiving an emergency transmission from somewhere your sensors must be underground. The only direction to proceed is into the vast jungle before you.
You continue onwards and your sensors inform you that the signal is now strong enough to track.
< Try to locate the transmission source or continue into the jungle?
> Try to locate the transmission source
You attempt to locate the transmission source.
You deploy nano Discomon into the ground to help your sensors map out the terrain under you.
Your sensors informs you that they were instantly destroyed.
A wild and huge blue Discomon jumps in front of you and fortifies itself!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon
> Battle the Discomon and win
The wild Discomon collapses backwards and the impact reveals a hole in the ground. The signal you heard earlier strengthens immediately.
You proceed down the ancient stairwell which is as much dirt and roots now as it is crumbling concrete.
It appears to be some kind of ancient laboratory.
A long hallway meets your gaze as you reach the bottom, and the entire facility has a faint purple glow to it.
A floating brain and a giant eye are at the end watching you. They seem to lock onto your presence immediately.
It looks at you through thousands of monitors now and demands that you identify yourself.
< Identify yourself and your purpose or prepare to battle this mysterious force?
> Identify yourself and your purpose
The mysterious force seems to think the blue Discomon you defeated earlier has put you up to this!
It has been holding the mysterious force hostage for thousands of years!
Lights flash everywhere, Discomon appaer from every crevice of the laboratory. It is overwhelming force and you have no chance!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
You wake up months later and start to recall what happened...
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship slows down and wakes you up from cryosleep. You've arrived at the eighth planet of a vast white hole solar system..
The planet below you has a distinct purple colour to it.
Your sensors inform you that this is likely because of the white hole at the center of this solar system constantly adding new matter to the system.
< Land on planet or find a new solar system?
> Choose planet for your quest
You decide to visit the mysterious purple world.
You arrive on the surface of the planet and are surprised by what you see: A massive, barren landscape with no signs of life whatsoever.
The terrain of the planet is desolate teal Tundra extending as far as the eye can see.
Curiously, however, the ground appears to be just a thin layer on the surface, and you can see what appears to be a vast purple cave subterranean cave network through many translucent patches.
You continue walking forward and come across a hole in the ground which looks like an entrance to the subterranean caves below.
< Ignore the caves and continue onwards across the tundra or explore the caves?
> Ignore the caves and continue onwards across the tundra
You decide to ignore the caves for now and continue onwards across the tundra.
Far away in the distance lightning splits the horizon. Thunder soon follow.
As you continue across the tundra, you accidentally step on a well camouflaged Discomon.
You jump backwards and prepare to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You battle and defeat the wild Discomon.
You take a moment to recover and then press forward.
Gradually, the lightning starts striking the same place in unison in front of you.
Once synchronized, the lightning starts to incrementally strike closer & closer to you.
You debate whether you should continue onwards or head back to the ship.
< Continue onwards or head back to the ship?
> Continue onwards
You know you are protected from it with your bio-suit so you walk towards it.
As you get close, you are struck but are not harmed. Seems this planet's energy is harmless to you.
You continue into the cave under the bolts of lightning and notice markings on the wall.
The lightning then strikes next to you and the wall becomes animated with light!
The ceiling above you closes off and a Discomon is synthesized in front of you!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the Discomon.
You have almost no time to recover before another Discomon is created before your eyes!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!

> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship accelerates in reverse gradually over half a lightyear to save energy and reduce your cryosleep sickness.
Your ship begins to exhaust thrusters forward as you enter a moon of a gas giant in orbit around a blue hyper-giant main sequence star.
The planet below you appears to be covered in dense Jungle and looks like a healthy and fortified world.
< Visit this moon or find a new solar system?
> Investigate moon
You decide to Investigate moon.
As your ship enters the planet's atmosphere, you can see a large area of the Jungle that is dominated by blue rivers, mostly made of water.
The planet is extremely life-sustaining and must have an extensive eco-system.
Although, many of the intelligent animals are violent and tend to attack other creatures on sight.
Your ship finds a clearing at the edge of the river systems and the jungle.
< Do you want to explore the river systems or explore the jungle?
> Explore the jungle
You decide to explore the jungle instead of the river systems.
The jungle is extremely thick and the earth is dark with an excessive amount of plant growth.
The canopy above blocks most of the sunlight. It is almost as dark as night here.
The plants are noticeably carnivorous with many of them actively moving like animals.
You hack your way through the plantlife, creating a path with your sword.
Your ship's sensors detect an incredible amount of movement and activity in the vegetation around you. The jungle is watching you.
You continue onwards until a Discomon swoops in from above and prepares to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the wild Discomon and continue your journey into the jungle.
You can hear several creatures moving amongst the water, branches, and plants all around you.
Every sort of noise is being made from scampering limbs to leaves brushing against fabric.
The damp earth is easy to traverse and you make fast progress as you hack your path through the vegetation.
You step into a sink hole, and by the time you realize it, you are already submerged up to your knees!
< Do you allow the sink hole to swallow you or request your ship to rescue you?
> Allow the sink hole to swallow you
You give in to the sink hole.
The water increases in depth rapidly, reaching up to your waist, then chest, until you are forced to swim forward and struggle against the current that is rapidly dragging you into the heart of the rain forest.
You are whisked along through underwater caverns formed by exposed tree roots and branches forming a freeway for aquatic creatures.
Eventually, you manage to grab hold of some roots hanging from the cavern roof and anchor yourself in place. You stop yourself from being dragged further underwater and soon find that the current is strong enough that you can walk alongside it if you hang onto the roots.
Slowly, sparingly, you move forward using the roots as foot and handholds.
You spend a long time traversing the underwater highways of the rainforest.
A Discomon appears in front of you inquisitively, until it realizes your intent for their world and prepares to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!

<|startoftext|>Your ship's AI wakes you up from cryosleep as you've entered the orbit of the fourth moon of a gas giant of a main sequence star solar system..
This planet has a beautiful blue hue to it that reminds you of earth.
< Visit this moon or find a new solar system?
> Investigate moon
You decide to Investigate moon. As you descend through the planet's thick nitrogen atmosphere, you notice that it is also dotted with interesting yellow geography.
You land your ship in a clearing near the equator. Your ship's readout tells you that there are blue rivers of water to your East and cracked salt flats to your Southeast.
< Do you want to head East or Southeast?
> Head East
You decide to head East. You see no reason to go South.
As you travel along the blue rivers, you begin noticing strange creatures swimming amongst them.
You continue along the side of the river, these creatures following you, until you come to an impasse of thick mangroves.
They watch on intently.
> Walk on the river's surface to cross
Your sensors claim that the surface tension should allow for walking on water to be viable, however it says that there is a lot of uncertainty due to the undercurrents.
As you near the half-way point of the river, a Discomon emerges from the depths in front of you and prepares for a battle!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You regain your focus after defeating the wild Discomon and continue to attempt to cross.
As you look North up the river in the direction you came from, you can see the straight creatures rushing towards you in unison.
You realize that these are Discomon and they are attempting to create a wave to knock you over!
You don't have time to react, you have to battle them!

< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You battle the wild Discomon and defeat it.
You are still hanging on by the overhead roots on the ceiling of the jungle cavern.
Soon, you find yourself at a fork in the root highway and do not know which way to go.
The river continues flowing to your right, but it is impossibly dark.
To your left goes against the flow of the water but there is light illuminating the way forward.
Do you go against the flow of the water to your left or with the flow of water to your right?
> Go right
You go with the flow of water to your right.
The current carries you for a considerable distance before depositing you in a different part of the rain forest.
The roots you were walking along get thicker and wider, making it a struggle to walk at times.
After a while, there is an overhand which acts as solid ground and makes for easy walking as opposed to fighting the flow of water earlier.
You continue like this for days on end.
You can't stop as the current is still too strong.
Your ship informs you that you are running low on exo-suit power and you should request it to rescue you soon.
< Do you request rescue from your ship or continue further?
> Continue further
You decide to continue on and allow the underground river to take you further.
A Discomon is dangling from the roots up ahead, it stops you with its feet and forces you into a battle!

<|startoftext|>Your ship slows down and wakes you up from cryosleep. You've arrived at the second planet of a vast neutron star solar system..
The planet below has a light yellow colour, but the atmosphere is too thick to glean much more than that.
Do you want to investigate this planet or find a new one?
< Explore planet or find a new solar system?
> Land on planet
Not wishing to stay in orbit around a planet you know nothing about, you fly your ship closer to gather additional information.
Your sensors detect significant volcanism in the world below.
Its report paints the picture of a world of vast yellow deserts, separated by volcanically active mountains.
It plots a good landing spots for both a volcano to the North and sand deserts to the South.
< Do you want to visit the volcanoes or the sand desert?
> Visit the volcanoes
You land your ship at the base of the volcano. You identify the entrance to a cave system around the volcano. The entrance has no loose rock or debris around it.
The ground here is solid stone: no ash, no loose gravel but is instead as hard as pavement.
You enter the cave system, and your exo-suit informs you that you cannot survive in temperatures this hot forever.
You continue deeper into the cave system.
You round a corner and find yourself staring at a majestic sight: in the middle of the cave is a large underground lake of boiling water. Its heat warms your face, despite being inside the cave.
It is not steam that makes the air hazy, but the scorching lava below.
A Discomon emerges from the lava critically and lands in front of you, prepare to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You battle the wild Discomon and defeat it.
As the opposing Discomon begins to fade away, the lava recedes, presenting you with a path forward through the caves.
You arrive at a thick, basaltic door.
You open it and find yourself on a lookout carved into the volcano. It is night, and you are breath-taking views of the stars above.
As you turn around to re-enter the caves, you come face to face with a Discomon standing in your way!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the Discomon and re-enter the cave system to continue your quest.
You continue deeper into the cave system, and stumble upon a large spherical area.
The walls are smooth, almost as if they were man-made. There is a machine protruding from the ground in the centre of the room, with an irregularly shaped hole in the middle.
The hole just fits over... a Discomon head! It looks to you to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!

<|startoftext|>You enter the orbit of the fourth moon of a gas giant of a main sequence star. This is a suitable location..
This planet has a beautiful blue hue to it that reminds you of earth.
< Investigate moon or find a new solar system?

This is not exactly the planet you were hoping for. You rest and then plot course for a new solar system in this galaxy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship's AI wakes you up from cryosleep as you've entered the orbit of the fourth moon of a gas giant of a white dwarf solar system..
The planet below you has vast blue oceans of water and a dense nitrogen atmosphere.
Your sensors tell you that you probably will only need to use your exo-suit's boots here here because the conditions are ideal, but you are likely going to need to walk on the surface of the oceans to get anywhere.
< Explore moon or find a new solar system?
> Land on moon
A huge wall of dense clouds sits in an ever-present eastern direction of your trajectory.
As you approach, you notice an ancient city spanning thousands of miles to the North of your chosen landing spot on the ocean.
You exit your ship and begin to walk on the water towards the animated ancient city. The surface tension of water like this is what your exo-suit's boots were designed for.
Thus, you are able to walk on the surface of water just as if it were solid ground.
Without warning, the water next to you begins to reverberate at increasingly fast rates.
The ripples break and a Discomon appears in front of you prepared for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You continue onwards on the ocean surface.
Your sight of the ancient city off in the distance appears to be swallowed by what seems to be clouds over the horizon.
Your sensors then inform you, in panicked fashion, that those are not clouds, but a gigantic tidal wave approaching you rapidly!
You might be okay to continue if you choose to submerge beneath the surface at the moment of impact, but you cannot tell how long it will take to pass, and you do not have your exo-suit equipped to last for too long.
You could also try to make it back to the ship and equip your exo-suit.
< Wait out the tidal wave by submerging, head back to your ship and equip your exo-suit, or head home?
> Wait out the tidal wave by submerging
You decide wait out the tidal wave by submerging and facing the tidal wave below the surface with your current protective gear.
As it is close to approaching, you can't help but be mesmerized by the sheer force of the wall of water approaching you.
The white dwarf star that the planet is in orbit around must have particularly powerful solar winds.
At the last second you submerge beneath the surface of the water and hold your breath waiting for it to pass.
As you feel the enormous wave pass over and above you, you sit and wait.
Are the rumbles and vibrations of the sheer size of this tidal wave subsiding?
< Should you wait longer for the tidal wave to pass?
> The tidal wave has passed
You ascend to the surface and sure enough, the tidal wave has passed safely.
You begin to walk on the surface again, relieved that that monstrosity of a wave had passed.
To your East you can see a captivating sparkling blue light, to your North you can still see the animated teal ancient city.
< Head East towards the sparkling blue light or continue North towards the animated ancient city?
> Head East
You head East towards the bright blue light in the distance intrigued as to what it could be.
A Discomon submerges from the depths in front of you and prepares for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You continue onwards towards the blue light.
Every now and then you see more Discomons passing you by beneath the surface.
You walk even faster to reach your destination soon...
You arrive at the blue light unperturbed.
An island surrounded by a glowing blue shield.
A series of complicated figures that resemble the ancient language are inscribed on each of the islands four sides.
You attempt to interface with the complex patterns but nothing happens.
The patterns are glowing, vivid and beautiful however.
At the North, South, East and West side of the blue shielded island are enormous pillars of light shooting into the sky.
The underwater pillar of light leading straight down into the depths.
< Swim downwards and explore the underwater pillar of light, or head home?

<|startoftext|>Your adventure begins in a dead end of a galaxy unknown to anyone except the most dedicated explorers. The galaxy was small, but brimming with life and potential for adventure.,
Your first stop is a a suitable location in a dying solar system being consumed by a black hole. This moon is the only place life has been discovered, and it is unique in that the entire solar system is slowly shifting out of existence.,
You are unsure how long you have until it disappears entirely, so you are determined to make the most of your trip.,
As you approach the moon you can't help but notice it's purple colour and arcane vibe,
It's strange to see something so purple and magical in a sea of black holes, dying stars, and white dwarf remnants.,
This moon is definitely a sight to see.
< Choose planet for your quest or find a new solar system?
> Visit this planet
The moon is more colorful and vibrant than you've seen in a while. There are trees, plants, flowers, and purple mountains that curve upward instead of downward like you're used to.
The mountains lay to your West, and border on their East what appears to be a crystal forest which gives off an animated teal coloured glow.
< Head West to the mountains or head Northeast towards the crystal forest?
> Head West to the mountains
You climb up the side of the mountain, scaling it with little effort. As you climb, you notice the blackness of space is replaced by a clear, starry night.
Swirls of blue, purple, and green whisk by as tiny asteroids collide and create new celestial bodies. It's almost hypnotic watching the universe create itself around you.
The cosmic light show distracted you from your surroundings, and a Discomon jumps in front of you to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You win the battle!
< Do you want to continue on this path or head home?
> Continue on this path
After a rather brief battle, you find yourself standing before a massive stone temple.
You've never seen architecture like this, with swirling patterns and strange symbols. It is both alien and familiar at the same time to you.
You walk up the steps of the temple and find yourself being drawn to a large purple gem that sits in the centre of a large gold emblem above the door.
< Try to grab the emblem or leave it alone?
> Leave it alone
Suddenly, the door of the temple opens, and a bright light emits from it, blinding you.
You wake up weeks later in a hospital in your home world, remembering nothing.

< Head East towards the sparkling blue light or continue North towards the animated ancient city?
> Continue North
You continue North towards the ancient city.
It's almost as if the entire city is encircled by an ancient wall, which starts and stops abruptly in several places.
It almost looks like some force caused the entire city to suddenly drop out of the sky.
As you approach, you discover that the building blocks of each structure look to be almost an exact replica of itself.
Each block is animated with a teal glow. You move closer to inspect the very first building block when you are sent spiraling into the city's center!
You recover yourself from being tossed and compose yourself.
The city around you appears to be glimmering and altering itself in a pattern of animated buildings!
You walk through the streets attempting to read any visible text on the street signs but to no avail.
One of the virtual building collapses into itself and a large teal Discomon appears from the ether prepared to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You win your battle and continue onward.
A ticker tape like image starts appearing on the sides of buildings and seems to point you towards the West of the ancient city.
Your sensors inform you that they've decoded a hidden message in the directions that suggests you should head East instead.
< Head West like the visible message suggests or head East like your sensors suggest the hidden message within suggests?
> Head East
You decide to head to the east, trusting your sensors over the message.
You walk through the ancient city for some time, the teal blocks that each building is made of are fascinating in different ways.
Suddenly, you are surrounded on all sides by Discomon! You have no chance to escape! Your sensors have deceived you.

<|startoftext|>You enter the orbit of the second moon of a gas giant of a blue-white supergiant main sequence star. This is a planet that matches your parameters..
Your ship's computer displays its findings on a holographic simulation in the bridge.
There is wildlife on this moon, and it radiates a stunning red colour.
< Explore moon or find a new solar system?
> Land on moon
You decide to Land on moon.
You are excited to explore this moon, finally, something is going right! You look at the simulation choose a spot within the electromagnetic field of the gas giant.
There is a bit of a wait for the ship's computer to finish its preparations, but eventually it's ready for you to disembark.
It informs you that this planet is completely barren outside of the blue mountains to your North.
You find it strange that the planet appeared so red from space, but doesn't seem to give off this colour at all at ground level.
You go through the airlock and open up the docking hatch, heading towards the mountains to the North as they are they only apparent destination here.
As you make your journey you are forced to pace yourself; the planet's magnetosphere is much different than the Earth's, meaning that you can't rely on magnetic North to keep you on a straight path.
Instead, you must use a compass. Once you reach the base of the mountains, however, your efforts have proven worthwhile.
You begin to climb the mountain, but before too long you notice that things are beginning to appear more red again.
You look behind you and the barren landscape appears to be almost translucent, as if much of it were actually windows covered in dirt.
< Descend from your climb and see what is below the ground or continue climbing?
> Descend and see what is below ground
You climb back down the mountain and approach the barren land with newfound interest.
Your suit blows the surface material away revealing what you suspected, ceiling windows to some ancient laboratory.
The more you clean off, the more the brilliant critical red light shines through.
You test if the material the roof window was made of will support your weight and you learn that it will.
You cut a circular hole in the window, pushing it through, and attach a clamp to it.
You descend into the ancient laboratory.
Once inside the lab you look around in awe as the entire room is a mess of hundreds of chemistry sets, beakers and burners.
You accidentally knock over a rusting beaker and it smashes on the floor.
The liquid spilled then amazingly reverses entropy and from it materializes a Discomon!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You fist pump in satisfaction for your victory.
You find what you believe to be the databases the ship mentioned and you copy their contents onto a portable drive.
Upon inspection you find schematics which reveal this place to have a number of wings you haven't explored yet.
You head down another corridor...
Your mind races to imagine what the government of the civilization you're looking at could be like... Democracy? Autocracy? Capitalist? Socialist?
You turn a corner and a red hologram of a lifeform appears in front of you.
It warns you that continuing deeper is almost certain demise and insists that you leave now.
< Do you ignore the lifeform and continue into the ancient laboratory or head home?
> Head home early
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship slows down and wakes you up from cryosleep. You've arrived at the eighth planet of a vast white hole solar system..
The planet below you has a distinct purple colour to it.
Your sensors inform you that this is likely because of the white hole at the center of this solar system constantly adding new matter to the system.
< Explore planet or find a new solar system?
> Land on planet
You decide to visit the mysterious purple world.
You arrive on the surface of the planet and are surprised by what you see: A massive, barren landscape with no signs of life whatsoever.
The terrain of the planet is desolate teal Tundra extending as far as the eye can see.
Curiously, however, the ground appears to be just a thin layer on the surface, and you can see what appears to be a vast purple cave subterranean cave network through many translucent patches.
You continue walking forward and come across a hole in the ground which looks like an entrance to the subterranean caves below.
< Ignore the caves and continue onwards across the tundra or explore the caves?
> Explore the caves?
You decide to explore the caves.
You drop into the hole and enter the cave system below.
The first thing you notice is how vividly purple they. The rocks shimmer emanate with purple luminescence.
Small plants dot the crevices and they look like something out of a fairy tale, like a night under the stars.
Your sensors inform you that it has detected a high concentration of Discomon signatures deeper in the cave.
< Do you wish to seek them out or head back to your ship?
> Seek them out
You decide to seek out the Discomon signatures.
You descend deeper into the cave.
Suddenly, you pick up 3 Discomon signatures in close vicinity to each other.
Do you want to approach them or avoid them?
< Do you wish to approach them out or head back to your ship?
> Approach them
As you come closer, you notice something is wrong with this Discomon: Its head is bloodied and it seems to be limping, dragging its hind legs behind it awkwardly.
Additionally, its signature is weak and erratic, almost feverish.
It charges you as it wants to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You enter the orbit of the fourth moon of a gas giant of a white dwarf. This is a planet that matches your parameters..
The planet below you has vast blue oceans of water and a dense nitrogen atmosphere.
Your sensors tell you that you probably will only need to use your exo-suit's boots here here because the conditions are ideal, but you are likely going to need to walk on the surface of the oceans to get anywhere.
< Visit this moon or find a new solar system?
> Investigate moon
A huge wall of dense clouds sits in an ever-present eastern direction of your trajectory.
As you approach, you notice an ancient city spanning thousands of miles to the North of your chosen landing spot on the ocean.
You exit your ship and begin to walk on the water towards the animated ancient city. The surface tension of water like this is what your exo-suit's boots were designed for.
Thus, you are able to walk on the surface of water just as if it were solid ground.
Without warning, the water next to you begins to reverberate at increasingly fast rates.
The ripples break and a Discomon appears in front of you prepared for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You continue onwards on the ocean surface.
Your sight of the ancient city off in the distance appears to be swallowed by what seems to be clouds over the horizon.
Your sensors then inform you, in panicked fashion, that those are not clouds, but a gigantic tidal wave approaching you rapidly!
You might be okay to continue if you choose to submerge beneath the surface at the moment of impact, but you cannot tell how long it will take to pass, and you do not have your exo-suit equipped to last for too long.
You could also try to make it back to the ship and equip your exo-suit.
< Wait out the tidal wave by submerging, head back to your ship and equip your exo-suit, or head home?
> Wait out the tidal wave by submerging
You decide wait out the tidal wave by submerging and facing the tidal wave below the surface with your current protective gear.
As it is close to approaching, you can't help but be mesmerized by the sheer force of the wall of water approaching you.
The white dwarf star that the planet is in orbit around must have particularly powerful solar winds.
At the last second you submerge beneath the surface of the water and hold your breath waiting for it to pass.
As you feel the enormous wave pass over and above you, you sit and wait.
Are the rumbles and vibrations of the sheer size of this tidal wave subsiding?
< Should you wait longer for the tidal wave to pass?
> The tidal wave has passed
You ascend to the surface and sure enough, the tidal wave has passed safely.
You begin to walk on the surface again, relieved that that monstrosity of a wave had passed.
To your East you can see a captivating sparkling blue light, to your North you can still see the animated teal ancient city.
< Head East towards the sparkling blue light or continue North towards the animated ancient city?
> Head East
You head East towards the bright blue light in the distance intrigued as to what it could be.
A Discomon submerges from the depths in front of you and prepares for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You continue onwards towards the blue light.
Every now and then you see more Discomons passing you by beneath the surface.
You walk even faster to reach your destination soon...
You arrive at the blue light unperturbed.
An island surrounded by a glowing blue shield.
A series of complicated figures that resemble the ancient language are inscribed on each of the islands four sides.
You attempt to interface with the complex patterns but nothing happens.
The patterns are glowing, vivid and beautiful however.
At the North, South, East and West side of the blue shielded island are enormous pillars of light shooting into the sky.
The underwater pillar of light leading straight down into the depths.
< Swim downwards and explore the underwater pillar of light, or head home?
> Swim downwards
You decide to swim downwards and explore the underwater pillar of light.
A Discomon swims over to you, intrigued, and prepares to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship accelerates in reverse gradually over half a lightyear to save energy and reduce your cryosleep sickness.
Your sensors wake you as they've discovered a suitable location. Your sensors inform you that it is the fourth moon of a gas giant of a blue hyper-giant main sequence star..
The planet below you appears to be covered in dense Jungle and looks like a healthy and fortified world.
< Investigate moon or find a new solar system?
> Explore moon
You decide to Explore moon.
As your ship enters the planet's atmosphere, you can see a large area of the Jungle that is dominated by blue rivers, mostly made of water.
The planet is extremely life-sustaining and must have an extensive eco-system.
Although, many of the intelligent animals are violent and tend to attack other creatures on sight.
Your ship finds a clearing at the edge of the river systems and the jungle.
< Do you want to explore the river systems or explore the jungle?
> Explore the river systems
The river is one of the largest you've ever seen, perhaps with a width of twenty meters and a depth of eight meters. You almost get the urge to go for a swim.
Although, there are more important matters at hand.
There is strange, rich vegetation along the river and thick, dense Jungle otherwise. However, the ground is relatively flat and clear of large trees and plants.
The water of the river you're following has reacted strangely with your sensors; it is picking up an minor life-form reading but you can't see what it is detecting.
The river next to you parts and a Discomon emerges from the depths.
It rides the wake it created to the shore and lands in front of you ready for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You travel along the river and find a rather large stack of uprooted trees floating in one of the channels.
Intrigued, you order your ship to land on top of the flotilla so you can go out and investigate.
The other channel contains fractured tree trunks and branches.
You make a note of this, so you know not to go too far right or left of the rivers when travelling around it later.
A Discomon challenges you to a battle in the same fashion as the last one did!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You continue onwards, without coming across much of note for quite a while.
Eventually you notice a bright blue light shining in the river next to you.
Your sensors cannot identify what it is beyond it being an orb of some kind.
It appears to be emitting only emitting waves in the blue part of the visible light spectrum.
You cannot be sure if it is safe to interact with.
< Do you want to interact with the blue orb or ignore it?
> Interact with it
The orb flies over to you and you try to touch it, but it flies away and out of sight.
You follow it along the river and to your surprise it leads you to a portion of the river made up of underground S-bends.
It disappears under the edge of the river bank.
< Do you bend over the river bank and look for the orb, or continue on your journey?
> Bend over river bank
You bend over the river bank to see if you can identify where the orb has disappeared to.
It bursts through the ground under your feet as you do this and knocks you into the river. You get pulled into the underside of the S-bends!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
You wake up months later and start to recall what happened...
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spherical zones of various colors surround the planet. You take out your equipment and try to judge which direction you need to head in from here.
You exhale, step off the airship, and fall through a sea of purple mist. When you open your eyes, you see a brown planet with vast jungles below.
The light energy available from the impossible to forget blue supergiant star has led to most of the foliage and plants in this jungle having a blue colour.
< Explore moon or find a new solar system?
> Land on moon
As you land your ship receiving an emergency transmission from somewhere your sensors must be underground. The only direction to proceed is into the vast jungle before you.
You continue onwards and your sensors inform you that the signal is now strong enough to track.
< Try to locate the transmission source or continue into the jungle?
> Try to locate the transmission source
You attempt to locate the transmission source.
You deploy nano Discomon into the ground to help your sensors map out the terrain under you.
Your sensors informs you that they were instantly destroyed.
A wild and huge blue Discomon jumps in front of you and fortifies itself!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon
> Battle the Discomon and win
The wild Discomon collapses backwards and the impact reveals a hole in the ground. The signal you heard earlier strengthens immediately.
You proceed down the ancient stairwell which is as much dirt and roots now as it is crumbling concrete.
It appears to be some kind of ancient laboratory.
A long hallway meets your gaze as you reach the bottom, and the entire facility has a faint purple glow to it.
A floating brain and a giant eye are at the end watching you. They seem to lock onto your presence immediately.
It looks at you through thousands of monitors now and demands that you identify yourself.
< Identify yourself and your purpose or prepare to battle this mysterious force?
> Prepare to battle this mysterious force
Arcane Discomon descend from the the ceilings everywhere you can see.
It is a spectacle of overwhelming force. Everything fades away...
You wake up weeks later and you're still in the laboratory.
In front of you sits a Discomon and a pile of purple essence.
It thanks you for defeating the blue jungle Discomon that had been holding it hostage for thousands of years.
> Head home after successful quest
This was a productive quest. You signal to your ship that you want to leave.
> Receive essence and end quest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship slows down and wakes you up from cryosleep. You've arrived at the fourth moon of a gas giant of a vast main sequence star solar system..
This planet has a beautiful blue hue to it that reminds you of earth.
< Land on moon or find a new solar system?
> Choose moon for your quest
You decide to Choose moon for your quest. As you descend through the planet's thick nitrogen atmosphere, you notice that it is also dotted with interesting yellow geography.
You land your ship in a clearing near the equator. Your ship's readout tells you that there are blue rivers of water to your East and cracked salt flats to your Southeast.
< Do you want to head East or Southeast?
> Head Southeast
You head Southeast towards the salt flats. You can smell the salt in the air through your air ventilation as the air is nearly breathable.
Your can hear the crackle of your feet crushing the fragile salt footing beneath them. Your sensors tell you that this is likely Magnesium Sulfate.
Suddenly, the sand next to you begins to shake! A Discomon pushes its way upwards through the sand looking for a battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon
> Battle the Discomon and win
You regain yourself after the battle and ask yourself if you should continue.
< Do you want to continue on this path or head home?
> Continue on this path
You continue deeper on your path into the salt flats. You start to grow weary of the oppressive heat your suit is working so hard to prevent you from noticing.
The yellowish scenery here and the blue star illuminating it create a purplish horizon that seems to extend forever.
You scan the area with your suit's sensors but find no trace of anything living. However, you do find a hole in the ground nearby and decide to investigate it.
You shine a flashlight down the hole but see nothing but darkness. You shine your headlamp further in but can't see the bottom.
Dismayed by your useless foray into digging, you look up to continue on, but as you do so, your eyes meet the gaze of a Discomon staring at you menacingly and prepared for a battle.
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon
> Battle the Discomon and win
You ensure your Discomon are okay and then wonder if it's time to head home.

You win your battle with the Discomon and ask yourself if you've done all you need to.
< Do you want to continue on this path or head home?
> Continue on this path
You continue still deeper into the salt flats, growing slightly more tired as your quest progresses. The landscape here is truly desolate, with only small patches of life hidden away amidst the sand and rocks. This world seems to consist almost entirely of salt, sand, and rocks.
Suddenly, you hear a growl and turn around to find that a Discomon has snuck up behind you!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Continue on this path
You recalibrate yourself with your ship, and continue further into this desolate world. You are starting to feel quite exhausted. The sun here seems to be much more unforgiving than it did on your home planet.
You don't know how or why that is, but it feels as though you've been walking on this path for days. You take a water break, and decide to scan the area before continuing on.
Your suit's sensors pick up a shambling mass of lifeforms wandering the area nearby. You don't know what they are, but you get the impression that they're moving this way.
< Do you want to investigate the lifeforms or runaway?
> Investigate lifeforms
You approach the lifeforms and soon realize they're Discomons wanting to battle!

< Continue on this path or head home?
> Continue on this path
You recalibrate yourself with your ship, and continue further into this desolate world. You are starting to feel quite exhausted. The sun here seems to be much more unforgiving than it did on your home planet.
You don't know how or why that is, but it feels as though you've been walking on this path for days. You take a water break, and decide to scan the area before continuing on.
Your suit's sensors pick up a shambling mass of lifeforms wandering the area nearby. You don't know what they are, but you get the impression that they're moving this way.

<|startoftext|>Your ship slows down and wakes you up from cryosleep. You've arrived at the fourth moon of a gas giant of a vast neutron star solar system..
The planet below you has a brilliant red colour to it and your sensors inform you that it's likely to be too hot to survive in normal conditions. Luckily, however, your exo-suit should be able to handle it for a long period of time.
There's a strong source of geothermal energy below as well as possible non-sentient life and your quest is to recover an essence of this world for preservation.
Your sensors inform you that the geothermal energy is a by-product of neutronium refinement. Neutronium is invaluable for the construction of starships that must endure unregulated hyperspace.
< Explore moon or find a new solar system?

The hot springs glow with a red aura to them. You also see a strange structures on the surface of the moon. It appears as if they are of unnatural construction & likely ancient.
You find a small clearing in the hot springs and land your ship. You find a small clearing in the hot springs and land your ship. Exiting your ship, you see that the ground here is too warm and your heat shields are struggling to cope. You can hear a loud roar emanating from somewhere close by.
It's a good thing your hazard suit protects you from the intense heat. You take a look around, don't want to venture too far from the ship in case you need to make a quick escape.
Soon after your advance into the hot spring dotted landscape, a Discomon adapted to withstand the environment rides the plume of a hot spring and prepares for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
Taking a look around, you see an abundance of plant life in every direction. This is augmented by the hot-springs surrounding you. The planet is very humid.
Up ahead is a range of small hills that dot the horizon to your North. Your sensors inform you that the strongest radiation readings it gets are coming from over these hills.
It is likely that the strange structures you noticed on your way down are in this direction.
You likely only have enough time before your exo-suit needs repair to fully investigate the hot springs, or head over these hills.
< Head North towards the small hills or continue exploring the hot springs?
> Continue exploring the hot springs
You decide to continue exploring the hot springs. You walk for hours through the hot springs without much of anything happening.
Their beauty is almost mesmerizing and you feel like you should turn back... but the signs on your suit's energy alarm are becoming more frequent.
Then without warning a Discomon ascends from the boiling water of one of the hot springs and prepares for battle!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the Discomon and collect yourself. Your exo-suit are approaching the danger zone and your sensors inform you that you should really be leaving.
You consider it, but notice a glimmering object just up ahead. It could be essence, but investigating it would be cutting it close for your exo-suit.
You could put your suit into emergency mode, which will elongate the exo-suit's effective lifetime, but this will make you more vulnerable to battle with wild Discomon,
you could risk it and hope you have enough time remaining, or you could just head home.
< Put your suit into emergency mode, risk it and investigate or head home?
> Put your suit into emergency mode
You put your suit into emergency mode and advance towards the object.
As you approach the object a Discomon is printed by a materializing beam from the object and prepares for battle!
You have no chance and your exo-suit cannot even materialize a Discomon in response.
> Battle the Discomon and lose
You wake up days later with a pounding headache and a total lack of memory for what caused it...

You decide to head North towards the small hills.
The range slowly rises and falls in the distance. Your hazard suit keeps you comfortable, although you feel the strain on your suits life support systems.
As you pass the crest of the hills, a Discomon appears behind some large rocks in front of you and prepares for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the Discomon and continue over the crest of the hill. As soon as you reach the top, you look down on a brilliant ancient city.
This must be what your sensors were picking up on.
The entire ancient city before you emanates a soft glow. It looks almost otherworldly. It seems as if it has been here for eternity.
You take a moment to let the sights and the sounds envelop you. The only sound is the soft trickling of water that passes through the many cracks in the stones on which this city is built upon.
The city appears abandoned, and your sensors inform you that it is highly radioactive. It appears that some ancient civilization did not make it past the nuclear great filter and this city is a testament both to their advanced civilization and their untimely downfall.
Before you move to explore the city, your sensors pick up on a single Discomon wandering around in a pathway through the ruins about half a mile away from you.
< Investigate the Discomon or ignore it and continue into the city?
> Ignore it and continue into the city
You decide to ignore the Discomon and continue deeper into the city.
It appears that someone has already looted this place. All ancient structures and artifacts have been completely stripped.
All that seems to be left are ancient moss and fungus growing among the ruins.
You continue on, but your sensors seem to be detecting an energy reading coming from underground.
It appears to be getting stronger as you approach an old well in the middle of a clearing. The ruins of a stone building encircle the well, which is almost completely caved in.
After looking down the well, your sensors inform you that the depths of the well seem to be less radioactive and descending should allow your quest to continue for longer than it otherwise might have.
< Descend down the well or continue searching the city?
> Descend down the well
You descend down the well, landing on a narrow metal platform that seems to circle downward for hours. After about half an hour of descending, you reach the bottom of the well.
Cubes of metal seem to be embedded into the stone walls on every side. They appear to be emitting the energy that you were detecting earlier.
< Engage the cubes or head through the door at the bottom of the well?
> Engage the cubes
You decide to engage the cubes. They begin emanating a powerful green glow.
Then the green light becomes brighter and brighter and your sensors inform you that the radiation is increasing linearly with the glow.
It is too much to handle!

You wake up in a different place feeling like you should be disappointed...

<|startoftext|>Your ship accelerates in reverse gradually over half a lightyear to save energy and reduce your cryosleep sickness.
Your ship begins to accelerate in reverse as you enter a moon of a gas giant in orbit around a blue hyper-giant main sequence star.
The planet below you appears to be covered in dense Jungle and looks like a healthy and fortified world.
< Investigate moon or find a new solar system?
> Explore moon
You decide to Explore moon.
As your ship enters the planet's atmosphere, you can see a large area of the Jungle that is dominated by blue rivers, mostly made of water.
The planet is extremely life-sustaining and must have an extensive eco-system.
Although, many of the intelligent animals are violent and tend to attack other creatures on sight.
Your ship finds a clearing at the edge of the river systems and the jungle.
< Do you want to explore the river systems or explore the jungle?
> Explore the jungle
You decide to explore the jungle instead of the river systems.
The jungle is extremely thick and the earth is dark with an excessive amount of plant growth.
The canopy above blocks most of the sunlight. It is almost as dark as night here.
The plants are noticeably carnivorous with many of them actively moving like animals.
You hack your way through the plantlife, creating a path with your sword.
Your ship's sensors detect an incredible amount of movement and activity in the vegetation around you. The jungle is watching you.
You continue onwards until a Discomon swoops in from above and prepares to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the wild Discomon and continue your journey into the jungle.
You can hear several creatures moving amongst the water, branches, and plants all around you.
Every sort of noise is being made from scampering limbs to leaves brushing against fabric.
The damp earth is easy to traverse and you make fast progress as you hack your path through the vegetation.
You step into a sink hole, and by the time you realize it, you are already submerged up to your knees!
< Do you allow the sink hole to swallow you or request your ship to rescue you?
> Allow the sink hole to swallow you
You give in to the sink hole.
The water increases in depth rapidly, reaching up to your waist, then chest, until you are forced to swim forward and struggle against the current that is rapidly dragging you into the heart of the rain forest.
You are whisked along through underwater caverns formed by exposed tree roots and branches forming a freeway for aquatic creatures.
Eventually, you manage to grab hold of some roots hanging from the cavern roof and anchor yourself in place. You stop yourself from being dragged further underwater and soon find that the current is strong enough that you can walk alongside it if you hang onto the roots.
Slowly, sparingly, you move forward using the roots as foot and handholds.
You spend a long time traversing the underwater highways of the rainforest.
A Discomon appears in front of you inquisitively, until it realizes your intent for their world and prepares to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You battle the wild Discomon and defeat it.
You are still hanging on by the overhead roots on the ceiling of the jungle cavern.
Soon, you find yourself at a fork in the root highway and do not know which way to go.
The river continues flowing to your right, but it is impossibly dark.
To your left goes against the flow of the water but there is light illuminating the way forward.
Do you go against the flow of the water to your left or with the flow of water to your right?
> Go right
You go with the flow of water to your right.
The current carries you for a considerable distance before depositing you in a different part of the rain forest.
The roots you were walking along get thicker and wider, making it a struggle to walk at times.
After a while, there is an overhand which acts as solid ground and makes for easy walking as opposed to fighting the flow of water earlier.
You continue like this for days on end.
You can't stop as the current is still too strong.
Your ship informs you that you are running low on exo-suit power and you should request it to rescue you soon.
< Do you request rescue from your ship or continue further?
> Request rescue
You request rescue from your ship.
A few minutes later the ground above you starts to disintegrate and your ship appears overhead.

<|startoftext|>Your ship slows down and wakes you up from cryosleep. You've arrived at the eighth planet of a vast white hole solar system..
The planet below you has a distinct purple colour to it.
Your sensors inform you that this is likely because of the white hole at the center of this solar system constantly adding new matter to the system.
< Explore planet or find a new solar system?
> Land on planet
You decide to visit the mysterious purple world.
You arrive on the surface of the planet and are surprised by what you see: A massive, barren landscape with no signs of life whatsoever.
The terrain of the planet is desolate teal Tundra extending as far as the eye can see.
Curiously, however, the ground appears to be just a thin layer on the surface, and you can see what appears to be a vast purple cave subterranean cave network through many translucent patches.
You continue walking forward and come across a hole in the ground which looks like an entrance to the subterranean caves below.
< Ignore the caves and continue onwards across the tundra or explore the caves?
> Ignore the caves and continue onwards across the tundra
You decide to ignore the caves for now and continue onwards across the tundra.
Far away in the distance lightning splits the horizon. Thunder soon follow.
As you continue across the tundra, you accidentally step on a well camouflaged Discomon.
You jump backwards and prepare to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You battle and defeat the wild Discomon.
You take a moment to recover and then press forward.
Gradually, the lightning starts striking the same place in unison in front of you.
Once synchronized, the lightning starts to incrementally strike closer & closer to you.
You debate whether you should continue onwards or head back to the ship.
< Continue onwards or head back to the ship?
> Continue onwards
You know you are protected from it with your bio-suit so you walk towards it.
As you get close, you are struck but are not harmed. Seems this planet's energy is harmless to you.
You continue into the cave under the bolts of lightning and notice markings on the wall.
The lightning then strikes next to you and the wall becomes animated with light!
The ceiling above you closes off and a Discomon is synthesized in front of you!

<|startoftext|>Your adventure begins in a dead end of a galaxy unknown to anyone except the most dedicated explorers. The galaxy was small, but brimming with life and potential for adventure.,
Your first stop is a an ideal planet for sustaining Discomon in a dying solar system being consumed by a black hole. This moon is the only place life has been discovered, and it is unique in that the entire solar system is slowly shifting out of existence.,
You are unsure how long you have until it disappears entirely, so you are determined to make the most of your trip.,
As you approach the moon you can't help but notice it's purple colour and arcane vibe,
It's strange to see something so purple and magical in a sea of black holes, dying stars, and white dwarf remnants.,
This moon is definitely a sight to see.
< Land on planet or find a new solar system?
> Choose planet for your quest
The moon is more colorful and vibrant than you've seen in a while. There are trees, plants, flowers, and purple mountains that curve upward instead of downward like you're used to.
The mountains lay to your West, and border on their East what appears to be a crystal forest which gives off an animated teal coloured glow.
< Head West to the mountains or head Northeast towards the crystal forest?
> Head West to the mountains
You climb up the side of the mountain, scaling it with little effort. As you climb, you notice the blackness of space is replaced by a clear, starry night.
Swirls of blue, purple, and green whisk by as tiny asteroids collide and create new celestial bodies. It's almost hypnotic watching the universe create itself around you.

With some effort, you manage to find an overcome the nausea, exit your ship and take a look around.
Your sensors identify a path forward for you, but they inform you that they are not very certain of what the path contains.
< Should you follow your sensor's path into the crystal forest or head home?

Your sensors detected a much larger concentration of deep space probe markers in this part of the planet.
You begin to follow the markers.

You see something up ahead at the end of the trail, a strange, animated teal orb.
The orb is floating in the air and visual sensors can't seem to get a lock on it.
As you approach the orb, it changes its position faster than you would have thought possible.

Although, many of the intelligent animals are violent and tend to attack other creatures on sight.
Your ship finds a clearing at the edge of the river systems and the jungle.
< Do you want to explore the river systems or explore the jungle?

The river is one of the largest you've ever seen, perhaps with a width of twenty meters and a depth of eight meters. You almost get the urge to go for a swim.
Although, there are more important matters at hand.
There is strange, rich vegetation along the river and thick, dense Jungle otherwise. However, the ground is relatively flat and clear of large trees and plants.
The water of the river you're following has reacted strangely with your sensors; it is picking up an minor life-form reading but you can't see what it is detecting.
The river next to you parts and a Discomon emerges from the depths.
It rides the wake it created to the shore and lands in front of you ready for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!

You travel along the river and find a rather large stack of uprooted trees floating in one of the channels.
Intrigued, you order your ship to land on top of the flotilla so you can go out and investigate.
The other channel contains fractured tree trunks and branches.
You make a note of this, so you know not to go too far right or left of the rivers when travelling around it later.
A Discomon challenges you to a battle in the same fashion as the last one did!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!

You continue onwards, without coming across much of note for quite a while.
Eventually you notice a bright blue light shining in the river next to you.
Your sensors cannot identify what it is beyond it being an orb of some kind.
It appears to be emitting only emitting waves in the blue part of the visible light spectrum.
You cannot be sure if it is safe to interact with.
< Do you want to interact with the blue orb or ignore it?
> Interact with it
The orb flies over to you and you try to touch it, but it flies away and out of sight.
You follow it along the river and to your surprise it leads you to a portion of the river made up of underground S-bends.
It disappears under the edge of the river bank.
< Do you bend over the river bank and look for the orb, or continue on your journey?

Your ship manages to stabilize itself and it only reports minor damage.
After this is resolved, you notice for the first time that the planet is primarily a vibrant yellow colour.
< Investigate moon or find a new solar system?
> Find new solar system
This is not exactly the planet you were hoping for. You rest and then plot course for a new solar system in this galaxy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship begins to slow down as you enter a moon of a gas giant in orbit around a blue-white supergiant main sequence star.
Your ship's computer displays its findings on a holographic simulation in the bridge.
There is wildlife on this moon, and it radiates a stunning red colour.
< Choose moon for your quest or find a new solar system?
> Visit this moon
You decide to Visit this moon.
You are excited to explore this moon, finally, something is going right! You look at the simulation choose a spot within the electromagnetic field of the gas giant.
There is a bit of a wait for the ship's computer to finish its preparations, but eventually it's ready for you to disembark.
It informs you that this planet is completely barren outside of the blue mountains to your North.
You find it strange that the planet appeared so red from space, but doesn't seem to give off this colour at all at ground level.
You go through the airlock and open up the docking hatch, heading towards the mountains to the North as they are they only apparent destination here.
As you make your journey you are forced to pace yourself; the planet's magnetosphere is much different than the Earth's, meaning that you can't rely on magnetic North to keep you on a straight path.
Instead, you must use a compass. Once you reach the base of the mountains, however, your efforts have proven worthwhile.
You begin to climb the mountain, but before too long you notice that things are beginning to appear more red again.
You look behind you and the barren landscape appears to be almost translucent, as if much of it were actually windows covered in dirt.
< Descend from your climb and see what is below the ground or continue climbing?
> Continue climbing
Even though the redness does give you some doubts, you choose to ignore them and continue climbing.
You put your foot on the next rock and, once certain of your grip, begin to pull yourself up.
Despite the dirt that seems to coat every surface of this moon, the rocks themselves are solid and sharp; just how you like them.
Boulders bigger than houses litter the mountainside, some cracked in half from whatever disaster transpired here in the moon's dim and forgotten past.
It would seem that you were right to continue as you soon find what appears to be a cave leading deep into the internal mountain of the moon.
This seems like a good place to investigate.
< Enter the cave or continue along the mountainside?
> Continue along the mountainside
With a shrug you choose to leave the cave and continue on your journey, since the glowing object is not immediately visible again, the cave mouth reveals no secrets and you decide to continue on your way.
You've never been one for getting lost or wasting time so you begin the climb upward along the mountainside path.
The rocks are jagged, unforgiving and large but you refuse to allow such small things to stop you. Once you reach a plateau of sorts you decide to rest before scaling the next mountain.
You gaze out at the barren landscape, it's hard to believe that any kind of life could survive out here.
You continue attempting to summit the mountains.
Only a little while later, you come across another small plateau.
You shove your hand into a crevice in a pinch hold.
As you pull yourself over the edge, a Discomon is staring at you the entire way!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship accelerates in reverse gradually over half a lightyear to save energy and reduce your cryosleep sickness.
Your ship slows down and wakes you up from cryosleep. You've arrived at the fourth moon of a gas giant of a vast blue hyper-giant main sequence star solar system..
The planet below you appears to be covered in dense Jungle and looks like a healthy and fortified world.
< Choose moon for your quest or find a new solar system?
> Visit this moon
You decide to Visit this moon.
As your ship enters the planet's atmosphere, you can see a large area of the Jungle that is dominated by blue rivers, mostly made of water.
The planet is extremely life-sustaining and must have an extensive eco-system.
Although, many of the intelligent animals are violent and tend to attack other creatures on sight.
Your ship finds a clearing at the edge of the river systems and the jungle.
< Do you want to explore the river systems or explore the jungle?
> Explore the jungle
You decide to explore the jungle instead of the river systems.
The jungle is extremely thick and the earth is dark with an excessive amount of plant growth.
The canopy above blocks most of the sunlight. It is almost as dark as night here.
The plants are noticeably carnivorous with many of them actively moving like animals.
You hack your way through the plantlife, creating a path with your sword.
Your ship's sensors detect an incredible amount of movement and activity in the vegetation around you. The jungle is watching you.
You continue onwards until a Discomon swoops in from above and prepares to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the wild Discomon and continue your journey into the jungle.
You can hear several creatures moving amongst the water, branches, and plants all around you.
Every sort of noise is being made from scampering limbs to leaves brushing against fabric.
The damp earth is easy to traverse and you make fast progress as you hack your path through the vegetation.
You step into a sink hole, and by the time you realize it, you are already submerged up to your knees!
< Do you allow the sink hole to swallow you or request your ship to rescue you?
> Allow the sink hole to swallow you
You give in to the sink hole.
The water increases in depth rapidly, reaching up to your waist, then chest, until you are forced to swim forward and struggle against the current that is rapidly dragging you into the heart of the rain forest.
You are whisked along through underwater caverns formed by exposed tree roots and branches forming a freeway for aquatic creatures.
Eventually, you manage to grab hold of some roots hanging from the cavern roof and anchor yourself in place. You stop yourself from being dragged further underwater and soon find that the current is strong enough that you can walk alongside it if you hang onto the roots.
Slowly, sparingly, you move forward using the roots as foot and handholds.
You spend a long time traversing the underwater highways of the rainforest.
A Discomon appears in front of you inquisitively, until it realizes your intent for their world and prepares to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You battle the wild Discomon and defeat it.
You are still hanging on by the overhead roots on the ceiling of the jungle cavern.
Soon, you find yourself at a fork in the root highway and do not know which way to go.
The river continues flowing to your right, but it is impossibly dark.
To your left goes against the flow of the water but there is light illuminating the way forward.
Do you go against the flow of the water to your left or with the flow of water to your right?
> Go left
You head to your left, forcefully pulling yourself towards the light source.
You can see the exit on the opposite side of the river.
You carefully climb down the roots and exit through the archway on the opposite side to the river.
As you step back on the jungle floor, a Discomon appears.
You were probably using its passageways and home.
Prepare to battle!

<|startoftext|>Your ship accelerates in reverse gradually over half a lightyear to save energy and reduce your cryosleep sickness.
You enter the orbit of the fourth moon of a gas giant of a blue hyper-giant main sequence star. This is a planet that matches your parameters..
The planet below you appears to be covered in dense Jungle and looks like a healthy and fortified world.
< Land on moon or find a new solar system?

You decide to Choose moon for your quest.
As your ship enters the planet's atmosphere, you can see a large area of the Jungle that is dominated by blue rivers, mostly made of water.
The planet is extremely life-sustaining and must have an extensive eco-system.
Although, many of the intelligent animals are violent and tend to attack other creatures on sight.
Your ship finds a clearing at the edge of the river systems and the jungle.
< Do you want to explore the river systems or explore the jungle?
> Explore the river systems
The river is one of the largest you've ever seen, perhaps with a width of twenty meters and a depth of eight meters. You almost get the urge to go for a swim.
Although, there are more important matters at hand.
There is strange, rich vegetation along the river and thick, dense Jungle otherwise. However, the ground is relatively flat and clear of large trees and plants.
The water of the river you're following has reacted strangely with your sensors; it is picking up an minor life-form reading but you can't see what it is detecting.
The river next to you parts and a Discomon emerges from the depths.
It rides the wake it created to the shore and lands in front of you ready for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You travel along the river and find a rather large stack of uprooted trees floating in one of the channels.
Intrigued, you order your ship to land on top of the flotilla so you can go out and investigate.
The other channel contains fractured tree trunks and branches.
You make a note of this, so you know not to go too far right or left of the rivers when travelling around it later.
A Discomon challenges you to a battle in the same fashion as the last one did!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You continue onwards, without coming across much of note for quite a while.
Eventually you notice a bright blue light shining in the river next to you.
Your sensors cannot identify what it is beyond it being an orb of some kind.
It appears to be emitting only emitting waves in the blue part of the visible light spectrum.
You cannot be sure if it is safe to interact with.
< Do you want to interact with the blue orb or ignore it?
> Interact with it
You interact with the bright blue light that is in the river next to you.
You jump into the river and wade over to where it is shining and glowing the brightest.
The water is freezing cold. You reach out your hand to touch the orb of light.
You gently twist the top and bottom of the orb together and it opens.
The inside of the container is relatively flat, with a large blue button on the top.
It seems like the bottom of the container might be able to twist more.
< Press blue button or twist bottom of orb more?
> Twist bottom
You twist the bottom and the orb suddenly self-destructs!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
You wake up months later and start to recall what happened...

<|startoftext|>Your ship accelerates in reverse gradually over half a lightyear to save energy and reduce your cryosleep sickness.
You are jolted awake as your ship suddenly slow down for emergency protocol. Your sensors were not able to detect the planet you now find yourself in orbit around. It is the fourth moon of a gas giant of a blue hyper-giant main sequence star..

<|startoftext|>Your adventure begins in a dead end of a galaxy unknown to anyone except the most dedicated explorers. The galaxy was small, but brimming with life and potential for adventure.,
Your first stop is a a harsh planet that barely meets your criteria in a dying solar system being consumed by a black hole. This moon is the only place life has been discovered, and it is unique in that the entire solar system is slowly shifting out of existence.,
You are unsure how long you have until it disappears entirely, so you are determined to make the most of your trip.,
As you approach the moon you can't help but notice it's purple colour and arcane vibe,
It's strange to see something so purple and magical in a sea of black holes, dying stars, and white dwarf remnants.,
This moon is definitely a sight to see.
< Explore planet or find a new solar system?
> Land on planet
The moon is more colorful and vibrant than you've seen in a while. There are trees, plants, flowers, and purple mountains that curve upward instead of downward like you're used to.
The mountains lay to your West, and border on their East what appears to be a crystal forest which gives off an animated teal coloured glow.
< Head West to the mountains or head Northeast towards the crystal forest?
> Head West to the mountains
You climb up the side of the mountain, scaling it with little effort. As you climb, you notice the blackness of space is replaced by a clear, starry night.
Swirls of blue, purple, and green whisk by as tiny asteroids collide and create new celestial bodies. It's almost hypnotic watching the universe create itself around you.
The cosmic light show distracted you from your surroundings, and a Discomon jumps in front of you to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You win the battle!
< Do you want to continue on this path or head home?
> Continue on this path
After a rather brief battle, you find yourself standing before a massive stone temple.
You've never seen architecture like this, with swirling patterns and strange symbols. It is both alien and familiar at the same time to you.
You walk up the steps of the temple and find yourself being drawn to a large purple gem that sits in the centre of a large gold emblem above the door.
< Try to grab the emblem or leave it alone?
> Try to grab the emblem
You grab the emblem and place it around your neck. It glows purple for a moment before your body begins to phase out of reality.
You wake up some hours later in your ship with some purple essence

This planet has a beautiful blue hue to it that reminds you of earth.
< Explore moon or find a new solar system?
> Land on moon
You decide to Land on moon. As you descend through the planet's thick nitrogen atmosphere, you notice that it is also dotted with interesting yellow geography.
You land your ship in a clearing near the equator. Your ship's readout tells you that there are blue rivers of water to your East and cracked salt flats to your Southeast.
< Do you want to head East or Southeast?
> Head Southeast
You head Southeast towards the salt flats. You can smell the salt in the air through your air ventilation as the air is nearly breathable.
Your can hear the crackle of your feet crushing the fragile salt footing beneath them. Your sensors tell you that this is likely Magnesium Sulfate.
Suddenly, the sand next to you begins to shake! A Discomon pushes its way upwards through the sand looking for a battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon
> Battle the Discomon and win
You regain yourself after the battle and ask yourself if you should continue.
< Do you want to continue on this path or head home?
> Continue on this path
You continue deeper on your path into the salt flats. You start to grow weary of the oppressive heat your suit is working so hard to prevent you from noticing.
The yellowish scenery here and the blue star illuminating it create a purplish horizon that seems to extend forever.
You scan the area with your suit's sensors but find no trace of anything living. However, you do find a hole in the ground nearby and decide to investigate it.
You shine a flashlight down the hole but see nothing but darkness. You shine your headlamp further in but can't see the bottom.
Dismayed by your useless foray into digging, you look up to continue on, but as you do so, your eyes meet the gaze of a Discomon staring at you menacingly and prepared for a battle.

< Do you want to continue on this path or head home?

You continue still deeper into the salt flats, growing slightly more tired as your quest progresses. The landscape here is truly desolate, with only small patches of life hidden away amidst the sand and rocks. This world seems to consist almost entirely of salt, sand, and rocks.
Suddenly, you hear a growl and turn around to find that a Discomon has snuck up behind you!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Continue on this path
You recalibrate yourself with your ship, and continue further into this desolate world. You are starting to feel quite exhausted. The sun here seems to be much more unforgiving than it did on your home planet.
You don't know how or why that is, but it feels as though you've been walking on this path for days. You take a water break, and decide to scan the area before continuing on.
Your suit's sensors pick up a shambling mass of lifeforms wandering the area nearby. You don't know what they are, but you get the impression that they're moving this way.
< Do you want to investigate the lifeforms or runaway?

Do you want to investigate this planet or find a new one?
< Choose planet for your quest or find a new solar system?
> Visit this planet
Not wishing to stay in orbit around a planet you know nothing about, you fly your ship closer to gather additional information.
Your sensors detect significant volcanism in the world below.
Its report paints the picture of a world of vast yellow deserts, separated by volcanically active mountains.
It plots a good landing spots for both a volcano to the North and sand deserts to the South.
< Do you want to visit the volcanoes or the sand desert?
> Visit the sand desert
You decide to head to the desert, flying your shuttle closer to the surface than you did before.
Your sensors can now easily detect lifeforms on the planet, even before you enter visual range.
You land at the predetermined spot in the sand desert.
Over the horizon you can see a sandstorm picking up steam and heading towards you.
Your sensors are not able to identify the intensity of it and because of that, are not sure if your exo-suit will be able to survive them.
< Find a new landing spot, head home early or try to make it through the sandstorm?

You continue onwards towards the sandstorm, determined to make it through it.
The sandstorm ravages towards you, closer and closer.
When it is about to hit, you brace for impact.
Your suit appears to be holding fine, as the sand does not seem to be very abrasive.
You can only move slowly forward but you persist onwards on your quest.
The sandstorm appears to be intensifying and your sensors inform you that you should consider leaving soon.
Soon after your sensors finish their readout, a Discomon materializes out of the sandstorm and prepares to battle!

You decide to Explore moon. As you descend through the planet's thick nitrogen atmosphere, you notice that it is also dotted with interesting yellow geography.
You land your ship in a clearing near the equator. Your ship's readout tells you that there are blue rivers of water to your East and cracked salt flats to your Southeast.
< Do you want to head East or Southeast?
> Head East
You decide to head East. You see no reason to go South.
As you travel along the blue rivers, you begin noticing strange creatures swimming amongst them.
You continue along the side of the river, these creatures following you, until you come to an impasse of thick mangroves.
They watch on intently.
> Walk on the river's surface to cross
Your sensors claim that the surface tension should allow for walking on water to be viable, however it says that there is a lot of uncertainty due to the undercurrents.
As you near the half-way point of the river, a Discomon emerges from the depths in front of you and prepares for a battle!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You regain your focus after defeating the wild Discomon and continue to attempt to cross.
As you look North up the river in the direction you came from, you can see the straight creatures rushing towards you in unison.
You realize that these are Discomon and they are attempting to create a wave to knock you over!
You don't have time to react, you have to battle them!
> Battle the Discomon and win
The pack of Discomons were defeated and dropped a fortifying essence, you have what you came for!

<|startoftext|>You enter the orbit of the second moon of a gas giant of a blue-white supergiant main sequence star. This is a harsh planet that barely meets your criteria..
Your ship's computer displays its findings on a holographic simulation in the bridge.
There is wildlife on this moon, and it radiates a stunning red colour.
< Investigate moon or find a new solar system?
> Find new solar system
This is not exactly the planet you were hoping for. You rest and then plot course for a new solar system in this galaxy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You enter the orbit of the eighth planet of a white hole. This is a planet that matches your parameters..
The planet below you has a distinct purple colour to it.
Your sensors inform you that this is likely because of the white hole at the center of this solar system constantly adding new matter to the system.
< Explore planet or find a new solar system?
> Land on planet
You decide to visit the mysterious purple world.
You arrive on the surface of the planet and are surprised by what you see: A massive, barren landscape with no signs of life whatsoever.
The terrain of the planet is desolate teal Tundra extending as far as the eye can see.
Curiously, however, the ground appears to be just a thin layer on the surface, and you can see what appears to be a vast purple cave subterranean cave network through many translucent patches.
You continue walking forward and come across a hole in the ground which looks like an entrance to the subterranean caves below.
< Ignore the caves and continue onwards across the tundra or explore the caves?
> Ignore the caves and continue onwards across the tundra
You decide to ignore the caves for now and continue onwards across the tundra.
Far away in the distance lightning splits the horizon. Thunder soon follow.
As you continue across the tundra, you accidentally step on a well camouflaged Discomon.
You jump backwards and prepare to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You battle and defeat the wild Discomon.
You take a moment to recover and then press forward.
Gradually, the lightning starts striking the same place in unison in front of you.
Once synchronized, the lightning starts to incrementally strike closer & closer to you.
You debate whether you should continue onwards or head back to the ship.
< Continue onwards or head back to the ship?
> Head home early
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spherical zones of various colors surround the planet. You take out your equipment and try to judge which direction you need to head in from here.
You exhale, step off the airship, and fall through a sea of purple mist. When you open your eyes, you see a brown planet with vast jungles below.
The light energy available from the impossible to forget blue supergiant star has led to most of the foliage and plants in this jungle having a blue colour.
< Choose moon for your quest or find a new solar system?
> Visit this moon
As you land your ship receiving an emergency transmission from somewhere your sensors must be underground. The only direction to proceed is into the vast jungle before you.
You continue onwards and your sensors inform you that the signal is now strong enough to track.
< Try to locate the transmission source or continue into the jungle?
> Continue into the jungle
You continue step-by-step deeper into the jungles of this world. The signal fades into background noise.
You continue deeper into the jungle.
Without warning, a Discomon swoops down on you from a nearby fine and prepares to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon

<|startoftext|>You enter the orbit of the second moon of a gas giant of a red supergiant main sequence star. This is a harsh planet that barely meets your criteria..
Your ship starts to shudder violently, as if caught in an invisible vice. You see an enormous ring made up of solid ice and rock debris, surrounding the planet.
Your ship manages to stabilize itself and it only reports minor damage.
After this is resolved, you notice for the first time that the planet is primarily a vibrant yellow colour.
< Explore moon or find a new solar system?
> Land on moon
You decide to Land on moon and descend through the planet's brilliant yellow atmosphere.
At first you're concerned that your ship incorrectly identified this planet as one with solid ground, as it seems to go on forever.
Finally the sulfur clouds part and you get your first view of the ground of this planet.
Lakes of liquid ethane dot the landscape to your Southeast. To your North is what appears to be an endless sea of red sands
< Head Southeast towards the ethane lakes or head North towards the red sands?
> Head Southeast towards the ethane lakes
The atmospheres of the planet is so thick that it is simply impossible to miss what lies below you: huge, bubbling pools of flammable liquid.
You see a wake up ahead and as it nears, you realize that it's a Discomon!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You continue onwards as the lake begins to break apart into sequences of sand bars and lagoons.
Eventually you make it to several shallow banks that allow for easy access between the lagoons.
You set foot on dry land to find yourself under several glaring Discomon eyes.
Thousands of them begin to surface all around you, your sensors report approaching Discomons as if they were white noise.
There is nothing you can do.
The lead Discomon however walks up to you and gives you Zeal essence and motions for you to leave.
You do not think twice and leave immediately.

You prepare to depart with the spoils of a success quest in hand.

<|startoftext|>You enter the orbit of the second planet of a main sequence star. This is a harsh planet that barely meets your criteria..
The world below you has a thick red atmosphere. Its geography is a vivid teal colour.
< Investigate planet or find a new solar system?

You decide to Explore planet.
You begin to enter the planet's atmosphere when you realize that what you thought were red coloured clouds are actually floating deserts of bright red sand!
< Do you want to land on one of the floating red deserts or continue to the surface?
> Continue to the surface
You decide to continue to the teal surface of the planet.
As you get closer, you realize that the planet is covered in animated forests of crystals!
You avoid the tallest of them and your ship rapidly descends to an ideal landing spot.
The steep drop makes you feel queasy.
With some effort, you manage to find an overcome the nausea, exit your ship and take a look around.
Your sensors identify a path forward for you, but they inform you that they are not very certain of what the path contains.
< Should you follow your sensor's path into the crystal forest or head home?
> Follow your sensor's path into the crystal forest
Your sensors detected a much larger concentration of deep space probe markers in this part of the planet.
You begin to follow the markers.
There are markings that indicate a path for you.
You can't help notice a few bones scattered along the path, from smaller life-forms.
Your sensors are picking up markers in front and behind you.
< Do you want to follow the trail or turn back and continue on your ship's path?
> Turn back and continue on your ship's path
You turn back, ignoring the deep space probe markers in favour of your ship's original path.
You can't shake the feeling that something is watching you...
Unfortunately, there is nothing there. Your sensors give you nothing and your scanner picks up nothing out of the ordinary.
You begin to head back to your ship when you notice a strange rock on the ground...
The rock is currently unidentifiable.
< Do you want to pick it up or continue on your way?
> Continue on your way
You ignore the rock and decide to continue on the path deeper into the crystal forest.
Suddenly it begins to rain red sand from above.
The crystals around you begin to explode on contact from the sand!
Each one that is shattered produces another Discomon ready to battle you!
You are overwhelmed!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
You wake up in your ship hours later and it informs you that it saved you and your Discomon's lives...
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You enter the orbit of the fourth moon of a gas giant of a neutron star. This is a planet that matches your parameters..
The planet below you has a brilliant red colour to it and your sensors inform you that it's likely to be too hot to survive in normal conditions. Luckily, however, your exo-suit should be able to handle it for a long period of time.
There's a strong source of geothermal energy below as well as possible non-sentient life and your quest is to recover an essence of this world for preservation.
Your sensors inform you that the geothermal energy is a by-product of neutronium refinement. Neutronium is invaluable for the construction of starships that must endure unregulated hyperspace.
< Investigate moon or find a new solar system?
> Explore moon
The hot springs glow with a red aura to them. You also see a strange structures on the surface of the moon. It appears as if they are of unnatural construction & likely ancient.
You find a small clearing in the hot springs and land your ship. You find a small clearing in the hot springs and land your ship. Exiting your ship, you see that the ground here is too warm and your heat shields are struggling to cope. You can hear a loud roar emanating from somewhere close by.
It's a good thing your hazard suit protects you from the intense heat. You take a look around, don't want to venture too far from the ship in case you need to make a quick escape.
Soon after your advance into the hot spring dotted landscape, a Discomon adapted to withstand the environment rides the plume of a hot spring and prepares for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
Taking a look around, you see an abundance of plant life in every direction. This is augmented by the hot-springs surrounding you. The planet is very humid.
Up ahead is a range of small hills that dot the horizon to your North. Your sensors inform you that the strongest radiation readings it gets are coming from over these hills.
It is likely that the strange structures you noticed on your way down are in this direction.
You likely only have enough time before your exo-suit needs repair to fully investigate the hot springs, or head over these hills.
< Head North towards the small hills or continue exploring the hot springs?
> Head North towards the small hills
You decide to head North towards the small hills.
The range slowly rises and falls in the distance. Your hazard suit keeps you comfortable, although you feel the strain on your suits life support systems.
As you pass the crest of the hills, a Discomon appears behind some large rocks in front of you and prepares for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the Discomon and continue over the crest of the hill. As soon as you reach the top, you look down on a brilliant ancient city.
This must be what your sensors were picking up on.
The entire ancient city before you emanates a soft glow. It looks almost otherworldly. It seems as if it has been here for eternity.
You take a moment to let the sights and the sounds envelop you. The only sound is the soft trickling of water that passes through the many cracks in the stones on which this city is built upon.
The city appears abandoned, and your sensors inform you that it is highly radioactive. It appears that some ancient civilization did not make it past the nuclear great filter and this city is a testament both to their advanced civilization and their untimely downfall.
Before you move to explore the city, your sensors pick up on a single Discomon wandering around in a pathway through the ruins about half a mile away from you.
< Investigate the Discomon or ignore it and continue into the city?
> Ignore it and continue into the city
You decide to ignore the Discomon and continue deeper into the city.
It appears that someone has already looted this place. All ancient structures and artifacts have been completely stripped.
All that seems to be left are ancient moss and fungus growing among the ruins.
You continue on, but your sensors seem to be detecting an energy reading coming from underground.
It appears to be getting stronger as you approach an old well in the middle of a clearing. The ruins of a stone building encircle the well, which is almost completely caved in.
After looking down the well, your sensors inform you that the depths of the well seem to be less radioactive and descending should allow your quest to continue for longer than it otherwise might have.
< Descend down the well or continue searching the city?
> Continue searching the city
You decide to ignore the well and continue into the city.
Among all the dead ends created by collapsed and ruined buildings, you manage to stumble upon a clearing beyond which contains what appears to be a museum.
The large letters reading "Museum of the Ancients".
The entrance to this museum has been mostly destroyed, and inside you can just make out an entire collection of preserved creatures fetuses in bottles that line the shelves.
As you examine one of the bottles, it suddenly starts to crack. The noise it makes seems to echo throughout, but then you realize it's not an echo... every bottle is beginning to crack open!
Within an instant, all of the bottles have broken and, as you look closer, you see that these were not fetuses in the bottles at all... they are eggs!
The baby Discomon all look towards you and prepare to battle!

> Follow the trail
You follow the trail with the strange markings, ignoring your ship's suggested path.
You feel slightly more nauseous and your mind feels less keen. You must be losing some of your mental edge.
Stranger still, you seem to be going through the forest faster than normal. It's almost as if sweeping by the crystals with your hand moves you quickly past them.
You see something up ahead at the end of the trail, a strange, animated teal orb.
The orb is floating in the air and visual sensors can't seem to get a lock on it.
As you approach the orb, it changes its position faster than you would have thought possible.
For a moment it stops in place, perfectly still.
It then smashes a crystal next to you and a Discomon hops out ready to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the Discomon and the orb begins to disassemble itself into smaller and smaller components until all that remains is essence!
Suddenly it begins to rain red sand from above.

<|startoftext|>You are jolted awake as your ship suddenly exhaust thrusters forward for emergency protocol. Your sensors were not able to detect the planet you now find yourself in orbit around. It is the fourth moon of a gas giant of a white dwarf..
The planet below you has vast blue oceans of water and a dense nitrogen atmosphere.
Your sensors tell you that you probably will only need to use your exo-suit's boots here here because the conditions are ideal, but you are likely going to need to walk on the surface of the oceans to get anywhere.
< Land on moon or find a new solar system?
> Choose moon for your quest
A huge wall of dense clouds sits in an ever-present eastern direction of your trajectory.
As you approach, you notice an ancient city spanning thousands of miles to the North of your chosen landing spot on the ocean.
You exit your ship and begin to walk on the water towards the animated ancient city. The surface tension of water like this is what your exo-suit's boots were designed for.
Thus, you are able to walk on the surface of water just as if it were solid ground.
Without warning, the water next to you begins to reverberate at increasingly fast rates.
The ripples break and a Discomon appears in front of you prepared for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You continue onwards on the ocean surface.
Your sight of the ancient city off in the distance appears to be swallowed by what seems to be clouds over the horizon.
Your sensors then inform you, in panicked fashion, that those are not clouds, but a gigantic tidal wave approaching you rapidly!
You might be okay to continue if you choose to submerge beneath the surface at the moment of impact, but you cannot tell how long it will take to pass, and you do not have your exo-suit equipped to last for too long.
You could also try to make it back to the ship and equip your exo-suit.
< Wait out the tidal wave by submerging, head back to your ship and equip your exo-suit, or head home?
> Wait out the tidal wave by submerging
You decide wait out the tidal wave by submerging and facing the tidal wave below the surface with your current protective gear.
As it is close to approaching, you can't help but be mesmerized by the sheer force of the wall of water approaching you.
The white dwarf star that the planet is in orbit around must have particularly powerful solar winds.
At the last second you submerge beneath the surface of the water and hold your breath waiting for it to pass.
As you feel the enormous wave pass over and above you, you sit and wait.
Are the rumbles and vibrations of the sheer size of this tidal wave subsiding?
< Should you wait longer for the tidal wave to pass?
> The tidal wave has passed
You ascend to the surface and sure enough, the tidal wave has passed safely.
You begin to walk on the surface again, relieved that that monstrosity of a wave had passed.
To your East you can see a captivating sparkling blue light, to your North you can still see the animated teal ancient city.
< Head East towards the sparkling blue light or continue North towards the animated ancient city?
> Continue North
You continue North towards the ancient city.
It's almost as if the entire city is encircled by an ancient wall, which starts and stops abruptly in several places.
It almost looks like some force caused the entire city to suddenly drop out of the sky.
As you approach, you discover that the building blocks of each structure look to be almost an exact replica of itself.
Each block is animated with a teal glow. You move closer to inspect the very first building block when you are sent spiraling into the city's center!
You recover yourself from being tossed and compose yourself.
The city around you appears to be glimmering and altering itself in a pattern of animated buildings!
You walk through the streets attempting to read any visible text on the street signs but to no avail.
One of the virtual building collapses into itself and a large teal Discomon appears from the ether prepared to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You win your battle and continue onward.
A ticker tape like image starts appearing on the sides of buildings and seems to point you towards the West of the ancient city.
Your sensors inform you that they've decoded a hidden message in the directions that suggests you should head East instead.
< Head West like the visible message suggests or head East like your sensors suggest the hidden message within suggests?
> Head East
You decide to head to the east, trusting your sensors over the message.
You walk through the ancient city for some time, the teal blocks that each building is made of are fascinating in different ways.
You approach the area your sensors led you towards.
To your right you can see what appears to be a blocks length of streets caved out in the center creating almost a pit area.
A vibration emanates from your sensors to your far left.
You approach the vibration and come across a Discomon defending a large pile of teal animate essence!

You begin to enter the planet's atmosphere when you realize that what you thought were red coloured clouds are actually floating deserts of bright red sand!
< Do you want to land on one of the floating red deserts or continue to the surface?
> Continue to the surface
You decide to continue to the teal surface of the planet.
As you get closer, you realize that the planet is covered in animated forests of crystals!
You avoid the tallest of them and your ship rapidly descends to an ideal landing spot.
The steep drop makes you feel queasy.
With some effort, you manage to find an overcome the nausea, exit your ship and take a look around.
Your sensors identify a path forward for you, but they inform you that they are not very certain of what the path contains.
< Should you follow your sensor's path into the crystal forest or head home?
> Follow your sensor's path into the crystal forest
Your sensors detected a much larger concentration of deep space probe markers in this part of the planet.
You begin to follow the markers.
There are markings that indicate a path for you.
You can't help notice a few bones scattered along the path, from smaller life-forms.
Your sensors are picking up markers in front and behind you.
< Do you want to follow the trail or turn back and continue on your ship's path?
> Turn back and continue on your ship's path
You turn back, ignoring the deep space probe markers in favour of your ship's original path.
You can't shake the feeling that something is watching you...
Unfortunately, there is nothing there. Your sensors give you nothing and your scanner picks up nothing out of the ordinary.
You begin to head back to your ship when you notice a strange rock on the ground...
The rock is currently unidentifiable.
< Do you want to pick it up or continue on your way?
> Pick it up
You decide to pick up the rock.
As you do so, a crystal next to you shatters and a Discomon who is ready for battle appears!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your sensors wake you as they've happened upon a planet that matches your parameters. Your sensors inform you that it is the eighth planet of a white hole..
The planet below you has a distinct purple colour to it.
Your sensors inform you that this is likely because of the white hole at the center of this solar system constantly adding new matter to the system.
< Visit this planet or find a new solar system?
> Investigate planet
You decide to visit the mysterious purple world.
You arrive on the surface of the planet and are surprised by what you see: A massive, barren landscape with no signs of life whatsoever.
The terrain of the planet is desolate teal Tundra extending as far as the eye can see.
Curiously, however, the ground appears to be just a thin layer on the surface, and you can see what appears to be a vast purple cave subterranean cave network through many translucent patches.
You continue walking forward and come across a hole in the ground which looks like an entrance to the subterranean caves below.
< Ignore the caves and continue onwards across the tundra or explore the caves?
> Explore the caves?
You decide to explore the caves.
You drop into the hole and enter the cave system below.
The first thing you notice is how vividly purple they. The rocks shimmer emanate with purple luminescence.
Small plants dot the crevices and they look like something out of a fairy tale, like a night under the stars.
Your sensors inform you that it has detected a high concentration of Discomon signatures deeper in the cave.
< Do you wish to seek them out or head back to your ship?
> Seek them out
You decide to seek out the Discomon signatures.
You descend deeper into the cave.
Suddenly, you pick up 3 Discomon signatures in close vicinity to each other.
Do you want to approach them or avoid them?
< Do you wish to approach them out or head back to your ship?
> Approach them
As you come closer, you notice something is wrong with this Discomon: Its head is bloodied and it seems to be limping, dragging its hind legs behind it awkwardly.
Additionally, its signature is weak and erratic, almost feverish.
It charges you as it wants to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You can see more arcane Discomon ascending from the depths of the cave.
Your sensors map the area for you and inform you that you can either try to cut the Discomon off deeper in the cave, or move towards the surface and wait for them.
< Do you want to try to cut the Discomon off or move towards the surface and wait?
> Move towards surface and wait
You move towards the surface. As you do so, the light above starts to dim.
You look upwards and see thousands of Discomon blotting out the light.
> Battle the Discomon and lose
You wake up months later and start to recall what happened...
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship accelerates in reverse gradually over half a lightyear to save energy and reduce your cryosleep sickness.
You enter the orbit of the fourth moon of a gas giant of a blue hyper-giant main sequence star. This is a harsh planet that barely meets your criteria..
The planet below you appears to be covered in dense Jungle and looks like a healthy and fortified world.

<|startoftext|>Your sensors wake you as they've found an ideal planet for sustaining Discomon. Your sensors inform you that it is the fourth moon of a gas giant of a main sequence star..
This planet has a beautiful blue hue to it that reminds you of earth.
< Land on moon or find a new solar system?
> Choose moon for your quest
You decide to Choose moon for your quest. As you descend through the planet's thick nitrogen atmosphere, you notice that it is also dotted with interesting yellow geography.
You land your ship in a clearing near the equator. Your ship's readout tells you that there are blue rivers of water to your East and cracked salt flats to your Southeast.
< Do you want to head East or Southeast?
> Head Southeast
You head Southeast towards the salt flats. You can smell the salt in the air through your air ventilation as the air is nearly breathable.
Your can hear the crackle of your feet crushing the fragile salt footing beneath them. Your sensors tell you that this is likely Magnesium Sulfate.
Suddenly, the sand next to you begins to shake! A Discomon pushes its way upwards through the sand looking for a battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon
> Battle the Discomon and win
You regain yourself after the battle and ask yourself if you should continue.
< Do you want to continue on this path or head home?
> Continue on this path
You continue deeper on your path into the salt flats. You start to grow weary of the oppressive heat your suit is working so hard to prevent you from noticing.
The yellowish scenery here and the blue star illuminating it create a purplish horizon that seems to extend forever.
You scan the area with your suit's sensors but find no trace of anything living. However, you do find a hole in the ground nearby and decide to investigate it.
You shine a flashlight down the hole but see nothing but darkness. You shine your headlamp further in but can't see the bottom.
Dismayed by your useless foray into digging, you look up to continue on, but as you do so, your eyes meet the gaze of a Discomon staring at you menacingly and prepared for a battle.
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon
> Battle the Discomon and win
You ensure your Discomon are okay and then wonder if it's time to head home.

You win your battle with the Discomon and ask yourself if you've done all you need to.
< Do you want to continue on this path or head home?
> Continue on this path
You continue still deeper into the salt flats, growing slightly more tired as your quest progresses. The landscape here is truly desolate, with only small patches of life hidden away amidst the sand and rocks. This world seems to consist almost entirely of salt, sand, and rocks.
Suddenly, you hear a growl and turn around to find that a Discomon has snuck up behind you!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Continue on this path
You recalibrate yourself with your ship, and continue further into this desolate world. You are starting to feel quite exhausted. The sun here seems to be much more unforgiving than it did on your home planet.
You don't know how or why that is, but it feels as though you've been walking on this path for days. You take a water break, and decide to scan the area before continuing on.
Your suit's sensors pick up a shambling mass of lifeforms wandering the area nearby. You don't know what they are, but you get the impression that they're moving this way.
< Do you want to investigate the lifeforms or runaway?
> Investigate lifeforms
You approach the lifeforms and soon realize they're Discomons wanting to battle!

Three Discomon become visible over the horizon. Your sensors warn you that you are unlikely to rise to the challenge, but that they are likely to come with high rewards.
You ignore its warnings and continue onwards
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
The opposing Discomon dropped its essence!
You take your prize and prepare to head home.

This was a productive quest. You signal to your ship that you want to leave.

<|startoftext|>You enter the orbit of the fourth moon of a gas giant of a white dwarf. This is a planet that matches your parameters..
The planet below you has vast blue oceans of water and a dense nitrogen atmosphere.
Your sensors tell you that you probably will only need to use your exo-suit's boots here here because the conditions are ideal, but you are likely going to need to walk on the surface of the oceans to get anywhere.
< Choose moon for your quest or find a new solar system?
> Visit this moon
A huge wall of dense clouds sits in an ever-present eastern direction of your trajectory.
As you approach, you notice an ancient city spanning thousands of miles to the North of your chosen landing spot on the ocean.
You exit your ship and begin to walk on the water towards the animated ancient city. The surface tension of water like this is what your exo-suit's boots were designed for.
Thus, you are able to walk on the surface of water just as if it were solid ground.
Without warning, the water next to you begins to reverberate at increasingly fast rates.
The ripples break and a Discomon appears in front of you prepared for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You continue onwards on the ocean surface.
Your sight of the ancient city off in the distance appears to be swallowed by what seems to be clouds over the horizon.
Your sensors then inform you, in panicked fashion, that those are not clouds, but a gigantic tidal wave approaching you rapidly!
You might be okay to continue if you choose to submerge beneath the surface at the moment of impact, but you cannot tell how long it will take to pass, and you do not have your exo-suit equipped to last for too long.
You could also try to make it back to the ship and equip your exo-suit.
< Wait out the tidal wave by submerging, head back to your ship and equip your exo-suit, or head home?
> Wait out the tidal wave by submerging
You decide wait out the tidal wave by submerging and facing the tidal wave below the surface with your current protective gear.
As it is close to approaching, you can't help but be mesmerized by the sheer force of the wall of water approaching you.
The white dwarf star that the planet is in orbit around must have particularly powerful solar winds.
At the last second you submerge beneath the surface of the water and hold your breath waiting for it to pass.
As you feel the enormous wave pass over and above you, you sit and wait.
Are the rumbles and vibrations of the sheer size of this tidal wave subsiding?
< Should you wait longer for the tidal wave to pass?
> The tidal wave has passed
You ascend to the surface and sure enough, the tidal wave has passed safely.
You begin to walk on the surface again, relieved that that monstrosity of a wave had passed.
To your East you can see a captivating sparkling blue light, to your North you can still see the animated teal ancient city.
< Head East towards the sparkling blue light or continue North towards the animated ancient city?
> Continue North
You continue North towards the ancient city.
It's almost as if the entire city is encircled by an ancient wall, which starts and stops abruptly in several places.
It almost looks like some force caused the entire city to suddenly drop out of the sky.
As you approach, you discover that the building blocks of each structure look to be almost an exact replica of itself.
Each block is animated with a teal glow. You move closer to inspect the very first building block when you are sent spiraling into the city's center!
You recover yourself from being tossed and compose yourself.
The city around you appears to be glimmering and altering itself in a pattern of animated buildings!
You walk through the streets attempting to read any visible text on the street signs but to no avail.
One of the virtual building collapses into itself and a large teal Discomon appears from the ether prepared to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You win your battle and continue onward.
A ticker tape like image starts appearing on the sides of buildings and seems to point you towards the West of the ancient city.
Your sensors inform you that they've decoded a hidden message in the directions that suggests you should head East instead.
< Head West like the visible message suggests or head East like your sensors suggest the hidden message within suggests?
> Head East
You decide to head to the east, trusting your sensors over the message.
You walk through the ancient city for some time, the teal blocks that each building is made of are fascinating in different ways.
You approach the area your sensors led you towards.
To your right you can see what appears to be a blocks length of streets caved out in the center creating almost a pit area.
A vibration emanates from your sensors to your far left.
You approach the vibration and come across a Discomon defending a large pile of teal animate essence!

<|startoftext|>Your ship slows down and wakes you up from cryosleep. You've arrived at the second moon of a gas giant of a vast blue-white supergiant main sequence star solar system..
Your ship's computer displays its findings on a holographic simulation in the bridge.
There is wildlife on this moon, and it radiates a stunning red colour.
< Land on moon or find a new solar system?
> Choose moon for your quest
You decide to Choose moon for your quest.
You are excited to explore this moon, finally, something is going right! You look at the simulation choose a spot within the electromagnetic field of the gas giant.
There is a bit of a wait for the ship's computer to finish its preparations, but eventually it's ready for you to disembark.
It informs you that this planet is completely barren outside of the blue mountains to your North.
You find it strange that the planet appeared so red from space, but doesn't seem to give off this colour at all at ground level.
You go through the airlock and open up the docking hatch, heading towards the mountains to the North as they are they only apparent destination here.
As you make your journey you are forced to pace yourself; the planet's magnetosphere is much different than the Earth's, meaning that you can't rely on magnetic North to keep you on a straight path.
Instead, you must use a compass. Once you reach the base of the mountains, however, your efforts have proven worthwhile.
You begin to climb the mountain, but before too long you notice that things are beginning to appear more red again.
You look behind you and the barren landscape appears to be almost translucent, as if much of it were actually windows covered in dirt.
< Descend from your climb and see what is below the ground or continue climbing?
> Descend and see what is below ground
You climb back down the mountain and approach the barren land with newfound interest.
Your suit blows the surface material away revealing what you suspected, ceiling windows to some ancient laboratory.
The more you clean off, the more the brilliant critical red light shines through.
You test if the material the roof window was made of will support your weight and you learn that it will.
You cut a circular hole in the window, pushing it through, and attach a clamp to it.
You descend into the ancient laboratory.
Once inside the lab you look around in awe as the entire room is a mess of hundreds of chemistry sets, beakers and burners.
You accidentally knock over a rusting beaker and it smashes on the floor.
The liquid spilled then amazingly reverses entropy and from it materializes a Discomon!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You fist pump in satisfaction for your victory.
You find what you believe to be the databases the ship mentioned and you copy their contents onto a portable drive.
Upon inspection you find schematics which reveal this place to have a number of wings you haven't explored yet.
You head down another corridor...
Your mind races to imagine what the government of the civilization you're looking at could be like... Democracy? Autocracy? Capitalist? Socialist?
You turn a corner and a red hologram of a lifeform appears in front of you.
It warns you that continuing deeper is almost certain demise and insists that you leave now.
< Do you ignore the lifeform and continue into the ancient laboratory or head home?
> Continue into the ancient laboratory
Having risked life and limb to come here you will not go away empty-handed.
You find rows upon rows of metal shelves filled with beakers and burners and Bunsen burners and chemistry sets.
Your mere presence set aflame the entire corner of the building in front of you, clearly whoever last survived this place didn't want anyone to know what they were doing.
You take a beaker and try to read the inscriptions, but the beaker disintegrates in your hands before you can discover what's written on it.
The entire building is coming apart, with bookshelves and desks and red and blue chairs and other furniture arranging themselves into nonsensical ways.
A metal sculpture resembling a snake twists and contorts itself through a series of loops before your eyes.
It then morphs into a Discomon who prepares for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the Discomon and it drops red essence on the ground in its place.
The additional commotion appears to set off some kind of chain reaction, and beakers, glassware, ceilings all begin to collapse!
Your ship swoops in and takes you away. You have what you came for.

<|startoftext|>Your sensors wake you as they've discovered a suitable location. Your sensors inform you that it is the fourth moon of a gas giant of a neutron star..
The planet below you has a brilliant red colour to it and your sensors inform you that it's likely to be too hot to survive in normal conditions. Luckily, however, your exo-suit should be able to handle it for a long period of time.
There's a strong source of geothermal energy below as well as possible non-sentient life and your quest is to recover an essence of this world for preservation.
Your sensors inform you that the geothermal energy is a by-product of neutronium refinement. Neutronium is invaluable for the construction of starships that must endure unregulated hyperspace.
< Land on moon or find a new solar system?
> Choose moon for your quest
The hot springs glow with a red aura to them. You also see a strange structures on the surface of the moon. It appears as if they are of unnatural construction & likely ancient.
You find a small clearing in the hot springs and land your ship. You find a small clearing in the hot springs and land your ship. Exiting your ship, you see that the ground here is too warm and your heat shields are struggling to cope. You can hear a loud roar emanating from somewhere close by.
It's a good thing your hazard suit protects you from the intense heat. You take a look around, don't want to venture too far from the ship in case you need to make a quick escape.
Soon after your advance into the hot spring dotted landscape, a Discomon adapted to withstand the environment rides the plume of a hot spring and prepares for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
Taking a look around, you see an abundance of plant life in every direction. This is augmented by the hot-springs surrounding you. The planet is very humid.
Up ahead is a range of small hills that dot the horizon to your North. Your sensors inform you that the strongest radiation readings it gets are coming from over these hills.
It is likely that the strange structures you noticed on your way down are in this direction.
You likely only have enough time before your exo-suit needs repair to fully investigate the hot springs, or head over these hills.
< Head North towards the small hills or continue exploring the hot springs?
> Continue exploring the hot springs
You decide to continue exploring the hot springs. You walk for hours through the hot springs without much of anything happening.
Their beauty is almost mesmerizing and you feel like you should turn back... but the signs on your suit's energy alarm are becoming more frequent.
Then without warning a Discomon ascends from the boiling water of one of the hot springs and prepares for battle!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the Discomon and collect yourself. Your exo-suit are approaching the danger zone and your sensors inform you that you should really be leaving.
You consider it, but notice a glimmering object just up ahead. It could be essence, but investigating it would be cutting it close for your exo-suit.
You could put your suit into emergency mode, which will elongate the exo-suit's effective lifetime, but this will make you more vulnerable to battle with wild Discomon,
you could risk it and hope you have enough time remaining, or you could just head home.
< Put your suit into emergency mode, risk it and investigate or head home?
> Risk it and investigate
You decide to risk it and investigate the glimmering object.
You approach the object and find a strange black box emitting a strange green glow and providing heat to the area around it.
You dare not get too close, as it feels warmer the closer you get.
You take a quick look and see strange markings on it as well as two buttons, a green one and a yellow one.
< Do you want to press the green button or the yellow one?
> Press the yellow button
A Discomon of great strength is materialized from a beam emitted from the strange black box.
It prepares to battle you!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!

You put your foot on the next rock and, once certain of your grip, begin to pull yourself up.
Despite the dirt that seems to coat every surface of this moon, the rocks themselves are solid and sharp; just how you like them.
Boulders bigger than houses litter the mountainside, some cracked in half from whatever disaster transpired here in the moon's dim and forgotten past.
It would seem that you were right to continue as you soon find what appears to be a cave leading deep into the internal mountain of the moon.
This seems like a good place to investigate.
< Enter the cave or continue along the mountainside?
> Enter the cave
You decide to enter the cave, descending into its depths & continuing across its rocky interior.
The sound of rushing water soon greets your ears and you come across a shimmering pool at cave's end.
It would appear to be a pool of some kind; warm vapor emanates itself from the waters surface and you can see your distorted reflection looking back at you.
A lump of earth hangs over the pool as a crude bridge stretching across the pool. You decide to cross over it and take a closer inspection.
The waters surface is as still as a mirror, as you lean in for a closer inspection you notice a glowing object in the bottom of the pool.
Your sensors inform you that its density and energy portfolio indicates that it might be dangerous.
< Do you reach in and try to grab the object or ignore it?
> Ignore it
You decide the object might be best left alone, it's glow is not one that draws you to it and seems more like one that warns you away.
You turn to leave the cave but the silence here has proven to be an almost magnetic force, drawing your eye's back time and time again, as if begging you to look upon it once more.
< Do you go back for one last look or leave and continue on your journey?
> Continue on your journey
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship accelerates in reverse gradually over half a lightyear to save energy and reduce your cryosleep sickness.
Your ship's AI wakes you up from cryosleep as you've entered the orbit of the fourth moon of a gas giant of a blue hyper-giant main sequence star solar system..
The planet below you appears to be covered in dense Jungle and looks like a healthy and fortified world.
< Choose moon for your quest or find a new solar system?
> Visit this moon
You decide to Visit this moon.
As your ship enters the planet's atmosphere, you can see a large area of the Jungle that is dominated by blue rivers, mostly made of water.
The planet is extremely life-sustaining and must have an extensive eco-system.
Although, many of the intelligent animals are violent and tend to attack other creatures on sight.
Your ship finds a clearing at the edge of the river systems and the jungle.
< Do you want to explore the river systems or explore the jungle?
> Explore the river systems
The river is one of the largest you've ever seen, perhaps with a width of twenty meters and a depth of eight meters. You almost get the urge to go for a swim.
Although, there are more important matters at hand.
There is strange, rich vegetation along the river and thick, dense Jungle otherwise. However, the ground is relatively flat and clear of large trees and plants.
The water of the river you're following has reacted strangely with your sensors; it is picking up an minor life-form reading but you can't see what it is detecting.
The river next to you parts and a Discomon emerges from the depths.
It rides the wake it created to the shore and lands in front of you ready for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You travel along the river and find a rather large stack of uprooted trees floating in one of the channels.
Intrigued, you order your ship to land on top of the flotilla so you can go out and investigate.
The other channel contains fractured tree trunks and branches.
You make a note of this, so you know not to go too far right or left of the rivers when travelling around it later.
A Discomon challenges you to a battle in the same fashion as the last one did!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You continue onwards, without coming across much of note for quite a while.
Eventually you notice a bright blue light shining in the river next to you.
Your sensors cannot identify what it is beyond it being an orb of some kind.
It appears to be emitting only emitting waves in the blue part of the visible light spectrum.
You cannot be sure if it is safe to interact with.
< Do you want to interact with the blue orb or ignore it?
> Interact with it
The orb flies over to you and you try to touch it, but it flies away and out of sight.
You follow it along the river and to your surprise it leads you to a portion of the river made up of underground S-bends.
It disappears under the edge of the river bank.
< Do you bend over the river bank and look for the orb, or continue on your journey?
> Continue on your journey
You start walk along the river again when you hear a noise behind you.
You turn around and the orb has pushed itself through the ground close to where you were standing!
< Go back and investigate the orb again or ignore it and continue?
> Investigate the orb again
You turn around to investigate the orb again.
You pick it up and squeeze it from both the top and the bottom together and it opens.
The inside of the container is relatively flat, with a large blue button on the top.
It seems like the bottom of the container might be able to twist more.
< Press blue button or twist bottom of orb more?
> Press blue button
You press the blue button and the orb rearranges itself into a Discomon!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
Your ship swoops in at the last moment to rescue you!
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your sensors wake you as they've discovered a planet that matches your parameters. Your sensors inform you that it is the fourth moon of a gas giant of a main sequence star..
This planet has a beautiful blue hue to it that reminds you of earth.
< Land on moon or find a new solar system?
> Choose moon for your quest
You decide to Choose moon for your quest. As you descend through the planet's thick nitrogen atmosphere, you notice that it is also dotted with interesting yellow geography.
You land your ship in a clearing near the equator. Your ship's readout tells you that there are blue rivers of water to your East and cracked salt flats to your Southeast.
< Do you want to head East or Southeast?
> Head Southeast
You head Southeast towards the salt flats. You can smell the salt in the air through your air ventilation as the air is nearly breathable.
Your can hear the crackle of your feet crushing the fragile salt footing beneath them. Your sensors tell you that this is likely Magnesium Sulfate.
Suddenly, the sand next to you begins to shake! A Discomon pushes its way upwards through the sand looking for a battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon
> Battle the Discomon and win
You regain yourself after the battle and ask yourself if you should continue.
< Do you want to continue on this path or head home?
> Continue on this path
You continue deeper on your path into the salt flats. You start to grow weary of the oppressive heat your suit is working so hard to prevent you from noticing.
The yellowish scenery here and the blue star illuminating it create a purplish horizon that seems to extend forever.
You scan the area with your suit's sensors but find no trace of anything living. However, you do find a hole in the ground nearby and decide to investigate it.
You shine a flashlight down the hole but see nothing but darkness. You shine your headlamp further in but can't see the bottom.
Dismayed by your useless foray into digging, you look up to continue on, but as you do so, your eyes meet the gaze of a Discomon staring at you menacingly and prepared for a battle.
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon

You continue still deeper into the salt flats, growing slightly more tired as your quest progresses. The landscape here is truly desolate, with only small patches of life hidden away amidst the sand and rocks. This world seems to consist almost entirely of salt, sand, and rocks.
Suddenly, you hear a growl and turn around to find that a Discomon has snuck up behind you!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Continue on this path
You recalibrate yourself with your ship, and continue further into this desolate world. You are starting to feel quite exhausted. The sun here seems to be much more unforgiving than it did on your home planet.
You don't know how or why that is, but it feels as though you've been walking on this path for days. You take a water break, and decide to scan the area before continuing on.
Your suit's sensors pick up a shambling mass of lifeforms wandering the area nearby. You don't know what they are, but you get the impression that they're moving this way.
< Do you want to investigate the lifeforms or runaway?
> Runaway
You run away from the life-form and seem to escape safely. You might still be able to salvage your quest.
You continue onward passing through strange yellow plains of sand until you begin to notice tall sand structures rising out of the ground near the horizon.
The tallest and closest is easy to access, but the closer you get the less stable it seems.
< You see something glimmer at the top however, and need to decide if you should continue climbing or take a different path.
> Continue climbing
You climb and you climb until your knuckles bleed, but you push on.
The golden figure that once sat atop the spire has been worn down by centuries of sandstorms.
You see at the summit a large amount of Zeal essence, but your finger slips.
You manage to hang on with one foot and one hand.
< Swing body around the side and go for a better grip or lunge for essence?
> Swing body around the side and go for a better grip
Your fingers are prickled with pain. You lunged for the essence but you missed it by a short distance.
You lunge again and it causes you to lose your grip over the top of the spire.

<|startoftext|>Your ship begins to slow down as you enter a moon of a gas giant in orbit around a white dwarf.
The planet below you has vast blue oceans of water and a dense nitrogen atmosphere.
Your sensors tell you that you probably will only need to use your exo-suit's boots here here because the conditions are ideal, but you are likely going to need to walk on the surface of the oceans to get anywhere.
< Land on moon or find a new solar system?
> Choose moon for your quest
A huge wall of dense clouds sits in an ever-present eastern direction of your trajectory.
As you approach, you notice an ancient city spanning thousands of miles to the North of your chosen landing spot on the ocean.
You exit your ship and begin to walk on the water towards the animated ancient city. The surface tension of water like this is what your exo-suit's boots were designed for.
Thus, you are able to walk on the surface of water just as if it were solid ground.
Without warning, the water next to you begins to reverberate at increasingly fast rates.
The ripples break and a Discomon appears in front of you prepared for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You continue onwards on the ocean surface.
Your sight of the ancient city off in the distance appears to be swallowed by what seems to be clouds over the horizon.
Your sensors then inform you, in panicked fashion, that those are not clouds, but a gigantic tidal wave approaching you rapidly!
You might be okay to continue if you choose to submerge beneath the surface at the moment of impact, but you cannot tell how long it will take to pass, and you do not have your exo-suit equipped to last for too long.
You could also try to make it back to the ship and equip your exo-suit.
< Wait out the tidal wave by submerging, head back to your ship and equip your exo-suit, or head home?
> Wait out the tidal wave by submerging
You decide wait out the tidal wave by submerging and facing the tidal wave below the surface with your current protective gear.
As it is close to approaching, you can't help but be mesmerized by the sheer force of the wall of water approaching you.
The white dwarf star that the planet is in orbit around must have particularly powerful solar winds.
At the last second you submerge beneath the surface of the water and hold your breath waiting for it to pass.
As you feel the enormous wave pass over and above you, you sit and wait.
Are the rumbles and vibrations of the sheer size of this tidal wave subsiding?
< Should you wait longer for the tidal wave to pass?
> The tidal wave has passed
You swim upwards towards the dim white light of the white dwarf.
You continue to swim and swim, upwards and upwards, but the surface of the water never seems to come.
The tidal wave has not yet passed!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
Flashing lights... Chaos... The last thing you remember seeing is the look of sheer terror and panic in your Discomon's eyes!

<|startoftext|>Your adventure begins in a dead end of a galaxy unknown to anyone except the most dedicated explorers. The galaxy was small, but brimming with life and potential for adventure.,
Your first stop is a a harsh planet that barely meets your criteria in a dying solar system being consumed by a black hole. This moon is the only place life has been discovered, and it is unique in that the entire solar system is slowly shifting out of existence.,
You are unsure how long you have until it disappears entirely, so you are determined to make the most of your trip.,
As you approach the moon you can't help but notice it's purple colour and arcane vibe,
It's strange to see something so purple and magical in a sea of black holes, dying stars, and white dwarf remnants.,
This moon is definitely a sight to see.
< Visit this planet or find a new solar system?
> Investigate planet
The moon is more colorful and vibrant than you've seen in a while. There are trees, plants, flowers, and purple mountains that curve upward instead of downward like you're used to.
The mountains lay to your West, and border on their East what appears to be a crystal forest which gives off an animated teal coloured glow.
< Head West to the mountains or head Northeast towards the crystal forest?
> Head Northeast towards the crystal forest
You head towards the crystal forest.
Something about this purple moon's juxtaposition against this teal crystal forest has drawn you here and you can't quite put your finger on what it is.
You begin to hear a strange sort of music in the distance, and you've never heard anything quite like it.
The music is unlike anything you've ever heard before... and yet it feels so strangely familiar...
You were distracted and did not notice the highly animated Discomon sneaking up on you looking for a battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
After winning you feel compelled by the animation of the things around you to continue further into the forest.
The trees begin to look stranger and stranger the deeper you go, and soon you seem to start to see the crystals take on a life of their own.
Suddenly a teal Discomon bursts from within the crystal next to you and you are forced to battle it!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You win, but the crystals begin to pulse with an intelligence of their own. The forest begins to come to life around you and you seem to be in the middle of it all.
You find yourself surrounded by Discomon and creatures made of pure crystal. The forest is alive, and it wants you to stay here with them...
As one approaches, it reaches it's hands out to you and hands you teal essence, and nods its head as to show respect.
You take your gift and head home.
> Head home after successful quest
This was a productive quest. You signal to your ship that you want to leave.
> Receive essence and end quest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You enter the orbit of the eighth planet of a white hole. This is an ideal planet for sustaining Discomon..
The planet below you has a distinct purple colour to it.
Your sensors inform you that this is likely because of the white hole at the center of this solar system constantly adding new matter to the system.
< Visit this planet or find a new solar system?
> Investigate planet
You decide to visit the mysterious purple world.
You arrive on the surface of the planet and are surprised by what you see: A massive, barren landscape with no signs of life whatsoever.
The terrain of the planet is desolate teal Tundra extending as far as the eye can see.
Curiously, however, the ground appears to be just a thin layer on the surface, and you can see what appears to be a vast purple cave subterranean cave network through many translucent patches.
You continue walking forward and come across a hole in the ground which looks like an entrance to the subterranean caves below.
< Ignore the caves and continue onwards across the tundra or explore the caves?
> Ignore the caves and continue onwards across the tundra
You decide to ignore the caves for now and continue onwards across the tundra.
Far away in the distance lightning splits the horizon. Thunder soon follow.
As you continue across the tundra, you accidentally step on a well camouflaged Discomon.
You jump backwards and prepare to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You battle and defeat the wild Discomon.
You take a moment to recover and then press forward.
Gradually, the lightning starts striking the same place in unison in front of you.
Once synchronized, the lightning starts to incrementally strike closer & closer to you.
You debate whether you should continue onwards or head back to the ship.
< Continue onwards or head back to the ship?
> Continue onwards
You know you are protected from it with your bio-suit so you walk towards it.
As you get close, you are struck but are not harmed. Seems this planet's energy is harmless to you.
You continue into the cave under the bolts of lightning and notice markings on the wall.
The lightning then strikes next to you and the wall becomes animated with light!
The ceiling above you closes off and a Discomon is synthesized in front of you!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the Discomon.
You have almost no time to recover before another Discomon is created before your eyes!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!

< Ignore the caves and continue onwards across the tundra or explore the caves?

You decide to explore the caves.
You drop into the hole and enter the cave system below.
The first thing you notice is how vividly purple they. The rocks shimmer emanate with purple luminescence.
Small plants dot the crevices and they look like something out of a fairy tale, like a night under the stars.
Your sensors inform you that it has detected a high concentration of Discomon signatures deeper in the cave.
< Do you wish to seek them out or head back to your ship?
> Head home early
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your sensors wake you as they've happened upon an ideal planet for sustaining Discomon. Your sensors inform you that it is the second moon of a gas giant of a blue-white supergiant main sequence star..
Your ship's computer displays its findings on a holographic simulation in the bridge.
There is wildlife on this moon, and it radiates a stunning red colour.
< Land on moon or find a new solar system?
> Choose moon for your quest
You decide to Choose moon for your quest.
You are excited to explore this moon, finally, something is going right! You look at the simulation choose a spot within the electromagnetic field of the gas giant.
There is a bit of a wait for the ship's computer to finish its preparations, but eventually it's ready for you to disembark.
It informs you that this planet is completely barren outside of the blue mountains to your North.
You find it strange that the planet appeared so red from space, but doesn't seem to give off this colour at all at ground level.
You go through the airlock and open up the docking hatch, heading towards the mountains to the North as they are they only apparent destination here.
As you make your journey you are forced to pace yourself; the planet's magnetosphere is much different than the Earth's, meaning that you can't rely on magnetic North to keep you on a straight path.
Instead, you must use a compass. Once you reach the base of the mountains, however, your efforts have proven worthwhile.
You begin to climb the mountain, but before too long you notice that things are beginning to appear more red again.
You look behind you and the barren landscape appears to be almost translucent, as if much of it were actually windows covered in dirt.
< Descend from your climb and see what is below the ground or continue climbing?
> Descend and see what is below ground
You climb back down the mountain and approach the barren land with newfound interest.
Your suit blows the surface material away revealing what you suspected, ceiling windows to some ancient laboratory.
The more you clean off, the more the brilliant critical red light shines through.
You test if the material the roof window was made of will support your weight and you learn that it will.
You cut a circular hole in the window, pushing it through, and attach a clamp to it.
You descend into the ancient laboratory.
Once inside the lab you look around in awe as the entire room is a mess of hundreds of chemistry sets, beakers and burners.
You accidentally knock over a rusting beaker and it smashes on the floor.
The liquid spilled then amazingly reverses entropy and from it materializes a Discomon!

Taking a look around, you see an abundance of plant life in every direction. This is augmented by the hot-springs surrounding you. The planet is very humid.
Up ahead is a range of small hills that dot the horizon to your North. Your sensors inform you that the strongest radiation readings it gets are coming from over these hills.
It is likely that the strange structures you noticed on your way down are in this direction.
You likely only have enough time before your exo-suit needs repair to fully investigate the hot springs, or head over these hills.
< Head North towards the small hills or continue exploring the hot springs?
> Continue exploring the hot springs
You decide to continue exploring the hot springs. You walk for hours through the hot springs without much of anything happening.
Their beauty is almost mesmerizing and you feel like you should turn back... but the signs on your suit's energy alarm are becoming more frequent.

This planet has a beautiful blue hue to it that reminds you of earth.
< Visit this moon or find a new solar system?
> Investigate moon
You decide to Investigate moon. As you descend through the planet's thick nitrogen atmosphere, you notice that it is also dotted with interesting yellow geography.
You land your ship in a clearing near the equator. Your ship's readout tells you that there are blue rivers of water to your East and cracked salt flats to your Southeast.
< Do you want to head East or Southeast?
> Head East
You decide to head East. You see no reason to go South.
As you travel along the blue rivers, you begin noticing strange creatures swimming amongst them.
You continue along the side of the river, these creatures following you, until you come to an impasse of thick mangroves.
They watch on intently.
> Walk on the river's surface to cross
Your sensors claim that the surface tension should allow for walking on water to be viable, however it says that there is a lot of uncertainty due to the undercurrents.
As you near the half-way point of the river, a Discomon emerges from the depths in front of you and prepares for a battle!

Your ship begins to accelerate in reverse as you enter a moon of a gas giant in orbit around a blue hyper-giant main sequence star.
The planet below you appears to be covered in dense Jungle and looks like a healthy and fortified world.
< Choose moon for your quest or find a new solar system?
> Visit this moon
You decide to Visit this moon.
As your ship enters the planet's atmosphere, you can see a large area of the Jungle that is dominated by blue rivers, mostly made of water.
The planet is extremely life-sustaining and must have an extensive eco-system.
Although, many of the intelligent animals are violent and tend to attack other creatures on sight.
Your ship finds a clearing at the edge of the river systems and the jungle.
< Do you want to explore the river systems or explore the jungle?
> Explore the jungle
You decide to explore the jungle instead of the river systems.
The jungle is extremely thick and the earth is dark with an excessive amount of plant growth.
The canopy above blocks most of the sunlight. It is almost as dark as night here.
The plants are noticeably carnivorous with many of them actively moving like animals.
You hack your way through the plantlife, creating a path with your sword.
Your ship's sensors detect an incredible amount of movement and activity in the vegetation around you. The jungle is watching you.
You continue onwards until a Discomon swoops in from above and prepares to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the wild Discomon and continue your journey into the jungle.
You can hear several creatures moving amongst the water, branches, and plants all around you.
Every sort of noise is being made from scampering limbs to leaves brushing against fabric.
The damp earth is easy to traverse and you make fast progress as you hack your path through the vegetation.
You step into a sink hole, and by the time you realize it, you are already submerged up to your knees!
< Do you allow the sink hole to swallow you or request your ship to rescue you?
> Allow the sink hole to swallow you
You give in to the sink hole.
The water increases in depth rapidly, reaching up to your waist, then chest, until you are forced to swim forward and struggle against the current that is rapidly dragging you into the heart of the rain forest.
You are whisked along through underwater caverns formed by exposed tree roots and branches forming a freeway for aquatic creatures.
Eventually, you manage to grab hold of some roots hanging from the cavern roof and anchor yourself in place. You stop yourself from being dragged further underwater and soon find that the current is strong enough that you can walk alongside it if you hang onto the roots.
Slowly, sparingly, you move forward using the roots as foot and handholds.
You spend a long time traversing the underwater highways of the rainforest.
A Discomon appears in front of you inquisitively, until it realizes your intent for their world and prepares to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You battle the wild Discomon and defeat it.
You are still hanging on by the overhead roots on the ceiling of the jungle cavern.
Soon, you find yourself at a fork in the root highway and do not know which way to go.
The river continues flowing to your right, but it is impossibly dark.
To your left goes against the flow of the water but there is light illuminating the way forward.
Do you go against the flow of the water to your left or with the flow of water to your right?
> Go right
You go with the flow of water to your right.
The current carries you for a considerable distance before depositing you in a different part of the rain forest.
The roots you were walking along get thicker and wider, making it a struggle to walk at times.
After a while, there is an overhand which acts as solid ground and makes for easy walking as opposed to fighting the flow of water earlier.
You continue like this for days on end.
You can't stop as the current is still too strong.
Your ship informs you that you are running low on exo-suit power and you should request it to rescue you soon.
< Do you request rescue from your ship or continue further?
> Continue further
You decide to continue on and allow the underground river to take you further.
A Discomon is dangling from the roots up ahead, it stops you with its feet and forces you into a battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the wild Discomon and it materializes into essence!
You request your ship to rescue you from your perilous position.

<|startoftext|>You enter the orbit of the second moon of a gas giant of a blue-white supergiant main sequence star. This is a planet that matches your parameters..
Your ship's computer displays its findings on a holographic simulation in the bridge.
There is wildlife on this moon, and it radiates a stunning red colour.
< Investigate moon or find a new solar system?
> Explore moon
You decide to Explore moon.
You are excited to explore this moon, finally, something is going right! You look at the simulation choose a spot within the electromagnetic field of the gas giant.
There is a bit of a wait for the ship's computer to finish its preparations, but eventually it's ready for you to disembark.
It informs you that this planet is completely barren outside of the blue mountains to your North.
You find it strange that the planet appeared so red from space, but doesn't seem to give off this colour at all at ground level.
You go through the airlock and open up the docking hatch, heading towards the mountains to the North as they are they only apparent destination here.
As you make your journey you are forced to pace yourself; the planet's magnetosphere is much different than the Earth's, meaning that you can't rely on magnetic North to keep you on a straight path.
Instead, you must use a compass. Once you reach the base of the mountains, however, your efforts have proven worthwhile.
You begin to climb the mountain, but before too long you notice that things are beginning to appear more red again.
You look behind you and the barren landscape appears to be almost translucent, as if much of it were actually windows covered in dirt.
< Descend from your climb and see what is below the ground or continue climbing?
> Continue climbing
Even though the redness does give you some doubts, you choose to ignore them and continue climbing.
You put your foot on the next rock and, once certain of your grip, begin to pull yourself up.
Despite the dirt that seems to coat every surface of this moon, the rocks themselves are solid and sharp; just how you like them.
Boulders bigger than houses litter the mountainside, some cracked in half from whatever disaster transpired here in the moon's dim and forgotten past.
It would seem that you were right to continue as you soon find what appears to be a cave leading deep into the internal mountain of the moon.
This seems like a good place to investigate.
< Enter the cave or continue along the mountainside?
> Enter the cave
You decide to enter the cave, descending into its depths & continuing across its rocky interior.
The sound of rushing water soon greets your ears and you come across a shimmering pool at cave's end.
It would appear to be a pool of some kind; warm vapor emanates itself from the waters surface and you can see your distorted reflection looking back at you.
A lump of earth hangs over the pool as a crude bridge stretching across the pool. You decide to cross over it and take a closer inspection.
The waters surface is as still as a mirror, as you lean in for a closer inspection you notice a glowing object in the bottom of the pool.
Your sensors inform you that its density and energy portfolio indicates that it might be dangerous.
< Do you reach in and try to grab the object or ignore it?
> Ignore it
You decide the object might be best left alone, it's glow is not one that draws you to it and seems more like one that warns you away.
You turn to leave the cave but the silence here has proven to be an almost magnetic force, drawing your eye's back time and time again, as if begging you to look upon it once more.
< Do you go back for one last look or leave and continue on your journey?
> Go back for one last look
You go back for one last look.
The moment your eyes meet with the center of the object, you are thrust into unimaginable nightmares.
You cannot continue like this!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
You wake up in your ship hours later and it informs you that it saved you and your Discomon's lives...
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship begins to slow down as you enter a moon of a gas giant in orbit around a white dwarf.
The planet below you has vast blue oceans of water and a dense nitrogen atmosphere.
Your sensors tell you that you probably will only need to use your exo-suit's boots here here because the conditions are ideal, but you are likely going to need to walk on the surface of the oceans to get anywhere.
< Choose moon for your quest or find a new solar system?
> Visit this moon
A huge wall of dense clouds sits in an ever-present eastern direction of your trajectory.
As you approach, you notice an ancient city spanning thousands of miles to the North of your chosen landing spot on the ocean.
You exit your ship and begin to walk on the water towards the animated ancient city. The surface tension of water like this is what your exo-suit's boots were designed for.
Thus, you are able to walk on the surface of water just as if it were solid ground.
Without warning, the water next to you begins to reverberate at increasingly fast rates.
The ripples break and a Discomon appears in front of you prepared for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You continue onwards on the ocean surface.
Your sight of the ancient city off in the distance appears to be swallowed by what seems to be clouds over the horizon.
Your sensors then inform you, in panicked fashion, that those are not clouds, but a gigantic tidal wave approaching you rapidly!
You might be okay to continue if you choose to submerge beneath the surface at the moment of impact, but you cannot tell how long it will take to pass, and you do not have your exo-suit equipped to last for too long.
You could also try to make it back to the ship and equip your exo-suit.
< Wait out the tidal wave by submerging, head back to your ship and equip your exo-suit, or head home?
> Wait out the tidal wave by submerging
You decide wait out the tidal wave by submerging and facing the tidal wave below the surface with your current protective gear.
As it is close to approaching, you can't help but be mesmerized by the sheer force of the wall of water approaching you.
The white dwarf star that the planet is in orbit around must have particularly powerful solar winds.
At the last second you submerge beneath the surface of the water and hold your breath waiting for it to pass.
As you feel the enormous wave pass over and above you, you sit and wait.
Are the rumbles and vibrations of the sheer size of this tidal wave subsiding?
< Should you wait longer for the tidal wave to pass?
> The tidal wave has passed
You ascend to the surface and sure enough, the tidal wave has passed safely.
You begin to walk on the surface again, relieved that that monstrosity of a wave had passed.
To your East you can see a captivating sparkling blue light, to your North you can still see the animated teal ancient city.
< Head East towards the sparkling blue light or continue North towards the animated ancient city?
> Continue North
You continue North towards the ancient city.
It's almost as if the entire city is encircled by an ancient wall, which starts and stops abruptly in several places.
It almost looks like some force caused the entire city to suddenly drop out of the sky.
As you approach, you discover that the building blocks of each structure look to be almost an exact replica of itself.
Each block is animated with a teal glow. You move closer to inspect the very first building block when you are sent spiraling into the city's center!
You recover yourself from being tossed and compose yourself.
The city around you appears to be glimmering and altering itself in a pattern of animated buildings!
You walk through the streets attempting to read any visible text on the street signs but to no avail.
One of the virtual building collapses into itself and a large teal Discomon appears from the ether prepared to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!

<|startoftext|>Your sensors wake you as they've found a planet that matches your parameters. Your sensors inform you that it is the fourth moon of a gas giant of a neutron star..
The planet below you has a brilliant red colour to it and your sensors inform you that it's likely to be too hot to survive in normal conditions. Luckily, however, your exo-suit should be able to handle it for a long period of time.
There's a strong source of geothermal energy below as well as possible non-sentient life and your quest is to recover an essence of this world for preservation.
Your sensors inform you that the geothermal energy is a by-product of neutronium refinement. Neutronium is invaluable for the construction of starships that must endure unregulated hyperspace.
< Choose moon for your quest or find a new solar system?
> Visit this moon
The hot springs glow with a red aura to them. You also see a strange structures on the surface of the moon. It appears as if they are of unnatural construction & likely ancient.
You find a small clearing in the hot springs and land your ship. You find a small clearing in the hot springs and land your ship. Exiting your ship, you see that the ground here is too warm and your heat shields are struggling to cope. You can hear a loud roar emanating from somewhere close by.
It's a good thing your hazard suit protects you from the intense heat. You take a look around, don't want to venture too far from the ship in case you need to make a quick escape.
Soon after your advance into the hot spring dotted landscape, a Discomon adapted to withstand the environment rides the plume of a hot spring and prepares for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
Taking a look around, you see an abundance of plant life in every direction. This is augmented by the hot-springs surrounding you. The planet is very humid.
Up ahead is a range of small hills that dot the horizon to your North. Your sensors inform you that the strongest radiation readings it gets are coming from over these hills.
It is likely that the strange structures you noticed on your way down are in this direction.
You likely only have enough time before your exo-suit needs repair to fully investigate the hot springs, or head over these hills.
< Head North towards the small hills or continue exploring the hot springs?
> Head North towards the small hills
You decide to head North towards the small hills.
The range slowly rises and falls in the distance. Your hazard suit keeps you comfortable, although you feel the strain on your suits life support systems.
As you pass the crest of the hills, a Discomon appears behind some large rocks in front of you and prepares for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the Discomon and continue over the crest of the hill. As soon as you reach the top, you look down on a brilliant ancient city.
This must be what your sensors were picking up on.
The entire ancient city before you emanates a soft glow. It looks almost otherworldly. It seems as if it has been here for eternity.
You take a moment to let the sights and the sounds envelop you. The only sound is the soft trickling of water that passes through the many cracks in the stones on which this city is built upon.
The city appears abandoned, and your sensors inform you that it is highly radioactive. It appears that some ancient civilization did not make it past the nuclear great filter and this city is a testament both to their advanced civilization and their untimely downfall.
Before you move to explore the city, your sensors pick up on a single Discomon wandering around in a pathway through the ruins about half a mile away from you.
< Investigate the Discomon or ignore it and continue into the city?
> Ignore it and continue into the city
You decide to ignore the Discomon and continue deeper into the city.
It appears that someone has already looted this place. All ancient structures and artifacts have been completely stripped.
All that seems to be left are ancient moss and fungus growing among the ruins.
You continue on, but your sensors seem to be detecting an energy reading coming from underground.
It appears to be getting stronger as you approach an old well in the middle of a clearing. The ruins of a stone building encircle the well, which is almost completely caved in.
After looking down the well, your sensors inform you that the depths of the well seem to be less radioactive and descending should allow your quest to continue for longer than it otherwise might have.
< Descend down the well or continue searching the city?
> Continue searching the city
You decide to ignore the well and continue into the city.
Among all the dead ends created by collapsed and ruined buildings, you manage to stumble upon a clearing beyond which contains what appears to be a museum.
The large letters reading "Museum of the Ancients".
The entrance to this museum has been mostly destroyed, and inside you can just make out an entire collection of preserved creatures fetuses in bottles that line the shelves.
As you examine one of the bottles, it suddenly starts to crack. The noise it makes seems to echo throughout, but then you realize it's not an echo... every bottle is beginning to crack open!
Within an instant, all of the bottles have broken and, as you look closer, you see that these were not fetuses in the bottles at all... they are eggs!
The baby Discomon all look towards you and prepare to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat all of the Discomon and notice that a magnetic force in the center of the museum appears to have a magnetic force for green radiation essence and has sucked the essence all of the defeated Discomon dropped!
You walk up to it and as you approach the magnetism appears to cease and the essence drops on the ground.
Your sensors inform you that it should be safe to pick it up.
You grab the green radiation essence and prepare to head home!

< Land on planet or find a new solar system?
> Choose planet for your quest
You decide to visit the mysterious purple world.
You arrive on the surface of the planet and are surprised by what you see: A massive, barren landscape with no signs of life whatsoever.
The terrain of the planet is desolate teal Tundra extending as far as the eye can see.
Curiously, however, the ground appears to be just a thin layer on the surface, and you can see what appears to be a vast purple cave subterranean cave network through many translucent patches.
You continue walking forward and come across a hole in the ground which looks like an entrance to the subterranean caves below.
< Ignore the caves and continue onwards across the tundra or explore the caves?
> Ignore the caves and continue onwards across the tundra
You decide to ignore the caves for now and continue onwards across the tundra.
Far away in the distance lightning splits the horizon. Thunder soon follow.
As you continue across the tundra, you accidentally step on a well camouflaged Discomon.
You jump backwards and prepare to battle!

You land your ship in a clearing near the equator. Your ship's readout tells you that there are blue rivers of water to your East and cracked salt flats to your Southeast.
< Do you want to head East or Southeast?
> Head Southeast
You head Southeast towards the salt flats. You can smell the salt in the air through your air ventilation as the air is nearly breathable.
Your can hear the crackle of your feet crushing the fragile salt footing beneath them. Your sensors tell you that this is likely Magnesium Sulfate.
Suddenly, the sand next to you begins to shake! A Discomon pushes its way upwards through the sand looking for a battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon
> Battle the Discomon and win
You regain yourself after the battle and ask yourself if you should continue.
< Do you want to continue on this path or head home?
> Continue on this path
You continue deeper on your path into the salt flats. You start to grow weary of the oppressive heat your suit is working so hard to prevent you from noticing.
The yellowish scenery here and the blue star illuminating it create a purplish horizon that seems to extend forever.
You scan the area with your suit's sensors but find no trace of anything living. However, you do find a hole in the ground nearby and decide to investigate it.
You shine a flashlight down the hole but see nothing but darkness. You shine your headlamp further in but can't see the bottom.
Dismayed by your useless foray into digging, you look up to continue on, but as you do so, your eyes meet the gaze of a Discomon staring at you menacingly and prepared for a battle.
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon

The river is one of the largest you've ever seen, perhaps with a width of twenty meters and a depth of eight meters. You almost get the urge to go for a swim.
Although, there are more important matters at hand.
There is strange, rich vegetation along the river and thick, dense Jungle otherwise. However, the ground is relatively flat and clear of large trees and plants.
The water of the river you're following has reacted strangely with your sensors; it is picking up an minor life-form reading but you can't see what it is detecting.
The river next to you parts and a Discomon emerges from the depths.
It rides the wake it created to the shore and lands in front of you ready for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You travel along the river and find a rather large stack of uprooted trees floating in one of the channels.
Intrigued, you order your ship to land on top of the flotilla so you can go out and investigate.
The other channel contains fractured tree trunks and branches.
You make a note of this, so you know not to go too far right or left of the rivers when travelling around it later.
A Discomon challenges you to a battle in the same fashion as the last one did!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You continue onwards, without coming across much of note for quite a while.
Eventually you notice a bright blue light shining in the river next to you.
Your sensors cannot identify what it is beyond it being an orb of some kind.
It appears to be emitting only emitting waves in the blue part of the visible light spectrum.
You cannot be sure if it is safe to interact with.
< Do you want to interact with the blue orb or ignore it?
> Interact with it
You interact with the bright blue light that is in the river next to you.
You jump into the river and wade over to where it is shining and glowing the brightest.
The water is freezing cold. You reach out your hand to touch the orb of light.
You gently twist the top and bottom of the orb together and it opens.
The inside of the container is relatively flat, with a large blue button on the top.
It seems like the bottom of the container might be able to twist more.
< Press blue button or twist bottom of orb more?
> Press blue button
You press the blue button and the orb rearranges itself into a Discomon!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
...What happened??
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship slows down and wakes you up from cryosleep. You've arrived at the fourth moon of a gas giant of a vast white dwarf solar system..
The planet below you has vast blue oceans of water and a dense nitrogen atmosphere.
Your sensors tell you that you probably will only need to use your exo-suit's boots here here because the conditions are ideal, but you are likely going to need to walk on the surface of the oceans to get anywhere.
< Visit this moon or find a new solar system?
> Investigate moon
A huge wall of dense clouds sits in an ever-present eastern direction of your trajectory.
As you approach, you notice an ancient city spanning thousands of miles to the North of your chosen landing spot on the ocean.
You exit your ship and begin to walk on the water towards the animated ancient city. The surface tension of water like this is what your exo-suit's boots were designed for.
Thus, you are able to walk on the surface of water just as if it were solid ground.
Without warning, the water next to you begins to reverberate at increasingly fast rates.
The ripples break and a Discomon appears in front of you prepared for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You continue onwards on the ocean surface.
Your sight of the ancient city off in the distance appears to be swallowed by what seems to be clouds over the horizon.
Your sensors then inform you, in panicked fashion, that those are not clouds, but a gigantic tidal wave approaching you rapidly!
You might be okay to continue if you choose to submerge beneath the surface at the moment of impact, but you cannot tell how long it will take to pass, and you do not have your exo-suit equipped to last for too long.
You could also try to make it back to the ship and equip your exo-suit.
< Wait out the tidal wave by submerging, head back to your ship and equip your exo-suit, or head home?
> Wait out the tidal wave by submerging
You decide wait out the tidal wave by submerging and facing the tidal wave below the surface with your current protective gear.
As it is close to approaching, you can't help but be mesmerized by the sheer force of the wall of water approaching you.
The white dwarf star that the planet is in orbit around must have particularly powerful solar winds.
At the last second you submerge beneath the surface of the water and hold your breath waiting for it to pass.
As you feel the enormous wave pass over and above you, you sit and wait.
Are the rumbles and vibrations of the sheer size of this tidal wave subsiding?
< Should you wait longer for the tidal wave to pass?
> The tidal wave has passed
You ascend to the surface and sure enough, the tidal wave has passed safely.
You begin to walk on the surface again, relieved that that monstrosity of a wave had passed.
To your East you can see a captivating sparkling blue light, to your North you can still see the animated teal ancient city.
< Head East towards the sparkling blue light or continue North towards the animated ancient city?
> Continue North
You continue North towards the ancient city.
It's almost as if the entire city is encircled by an ancient wall, which starts and stops abruptly in several places.
It almost looks like some force caused the entire city to suddenly drop out of the sky.
As you approach, you discover that the building blocks of each structure look to be almost an exact replica of itself.
Each block is animated with a teal glow. You move closer to inspect the very first building block when you are sent spiraling into the city's center!
You recover yourself from being tossed and compose yourself.
The city around you appears to be glimmering and altering itself in a pattern of animated buildings!
You walk through the streets attempting to read any visible text on the street signs but to no avail.
One of the virtual building collapses into itself and a large teal Discomon appears from the ether prepared to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You win your battle and continue onward.
A ticker tape like image starts appearing on the sides of buildings and seems to point you towards the West of the ancient city.
Your sensors inform you that they've decoded a hidden message in the directions that suggests you should head East instead.
< Head West like the visible message suggests or head East like your sensors suggest the hidden message within suggests?
> Head West
You decide to head to West, in the direction the tape like text was leading you, pacing quickly past decimated buildings.
You walk through the ancient city for some time, the teal blocks that each building is made of are fascinating in different ways.
Hold on, could this city actually be alive?
You squint your eyes.
You ignore the thought and continue onwards.
You reach the terminus of the directions the ticker tape was giving.
The city around you suddenly transforms and creates a gladiator stadium around you.
The gates underneath the seats opens and a Discomon appears for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
The city then closes in on you and then begins to disintegrate onto a small area in front of you.
It starts to create a pile of teal animated essence.
Seconds later the city is completely gone, now oceans again, except for the hovering essence in front of you.
You call your ship over and decide to head home.
> Head home after successful quest
Your quest has been a success. You prepare to head home.
> Receive essence and end quest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship accelerates in reverse gradually over half a lightyear to save energy and reduce your cryosleep sickness.
Your sensors wake you as they've happened upon a harsh planet that barely meets your criteria. Your sensors inform you that it is the fourth moon of a gas giant of a blue hyper-giant main sequence star..
The planet below you appears to be covered in dense Jungle and looks like a healthy and fortified world.
< Choose moon for your quest or find a new solar system?
> Visit this moon
You decide to Visit this moon.
As your ship enters the planet's atmosphere, you can see a large area of the Jungle that is dominated by blue rivers, mostly made of water.
The planet is extremely life-sustaining and must have an extensive eco-system.
Although, many of the intelligent animals are violent and tend to attack other creatures on sight.
Your ship finds a clearing at the edge of the river systems and the jungle.
< Do you want to explore the river systems or explore the jungle?
> Explore the river systems
The river is one of the largest you've ever seen, perhaps with a width of twenty meters and a depth of eight meters. You almost get the urge to go for a swim.

You cannot be sure if it is safe to interact with.
< Do you want to interact with the blue orb or ignore it?
> Interact with it
The orb flies over to you and you try to touch it, but it flies away and out of sight.
You follow it along the river and to your surprise it leads you to a portion of the river made up of underground S-bends.
It disappears under the edge of the river bank.
< Do you bend over the river bank and look for the orb, or continue on your journey?
> Continue on your journey
You start walk along the river again when you hear a noise behind you.
You turn around and the orb has pushed itself through the ground close to where you were standing!
< Go back and investigate the orb again or ignore it and continue?
> Investigate the orb again
You turn around to investigate the orb again.
You pick it up and squeeze it from both the top and the bottom together and it opens.
The inside of the container is relatively flat, with a large blue button on the top.
It seems like the bottom of the container might be able to twist more.
< Press blue button or twist bottom of orb more?
> Press blue button
You press the blue button and the orb rearranges itself into a Discomon!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the opposing Discomon.
The Discomon disintegrates into a pile of essence.
> Head home after successful quest
You prepare to depart with the spoils of a success quest in hand.
> Receive essence and end quest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You enter the orbit of the eighth planet of a white hole. This is an ideal planet for sustaining Discomon..
The planet below you has a distinct purple colour to it.
Your sensors inform you that this is likely because of the white hole at the center of this solar system constantly adding new matter to the system.
< Explore planet or find a new solar system?
> Land on planet
You decide to visit the mysterious purple world.
You arrive on the surface of the planet and are surprised by what you see: A massive, barren landscape with no signs of life whatsoever.
The terrain of the planet is desolate teal Tundra extending as far as the eye can see.
Curiously, however, the ground appears to be just a thin layer on the surface, and you can see what appears to be a vast purple cave subterranean cave network through many translucent patches.
You continue walking forward and come across a hole in the ground which looks like an entrance to the subterranean caves below.
< Ignore the caves and continue onwards across the tundra or explore the caves?
> Explore the caves?
You decide to explore the caves.
You drop into the hole and enter the cave system below.
The first thing you notice is how vividly purple they. The rocks shimmer emanate with purple luminescence.
Small plants dot the crevices and they look like something out of a fairy tale, like a night under the stars.
Your sensors inform you that it has detected a high concentration of Discomon signatures deeper in the cave.
< Do you wish to seek them out or head back to your ship?
> Seek them out
You decide to seek out the Discomon signatures.
You descend deeper into the cave.
Suddenly, you pick up 3 Discomon signatures in close vicinity to each other.
Do you want to approach them or avoid them?
< Do you wish to approach them out or head back to your ship?
> Head home early
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship's AI wakes you up from cryosleep as you've entered the orbit of the fourth moon of a gas giant of a main sequence star solar system..
This planet has a beautiful blue hue to it that reminds you of earth.
< Land on moon or find a new solar system?
> Choose moon for your quest
You decide to Choose moon for your quest. As you descend through the planet's thick nitrogen atmosphere, you notice that it is also dotted with interesting yellow geography.
You land your ship in a clearing near the equator. Your ship's readout tells you that there are blue rivers of water to your East and cracked salt flats to your Southeast.
< Do you want to head East or Southeast?
> Head East
You decide to head East. You see no reason to go South.
As you travel along the blue rivers, you begin noticing strange creatures swimming amongst them.
You continue along the side of the river, these creatures following you, until you come to an impasse of thick mangroves.
They watch on intently.

You judge this to be an impassable obstacle and decide to head home

< Do you wish to approach them out or head back to your ship?
> Approach them
As you come closer, you notice something is wrong with this Discomon: Its head is bloodied and it seems to be limping, dragging its hind legs behind it awkwardly.
Additionally, its signature is weak and erratic, almost feverish.
It charges you as it wants to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You can see more arcane Discomon ascending from the depths of the cave.
Your sensors map the area for you and inform you that you can either try to cut the Discomon off deeper in the cave, or move towards the surface and wait for them.
< Do you want to try to cut the Discomon off or move towards the surface and wait?

You move deeper into the cave and try to cut them off.
It appears to work. The first Discomon approaches and you prepare for battle.

<|startoftext|>Spherical zones of various colors surround the planet. You take out your equipment and try to judge which direction you need to head in from here.
You exhale, step off the airship, and fall through a sea of purple mist. When you open your eyes, you see a brown planet with vast jungles below.
The light energy available from the impossible to forget blue supergiant star has led to most of the foliage and plants in this jungle having a blue colour.
< Land on moon or find a new solar system?
> Choose moon for your quest
As you land your ship receiving an emergency transmission from somewhere your sensors must be underground. The only direction to proceed is into the vast jungle before you.
You continue onwards and your sensors inform you that the signal is now strong enough to track.
< Try to locate the transmission source or continue into the jungle?

You continue step-by-step deeper into the jungles of this world. The signal fades into background noise.
You continue deeper into the jungle.
Without warning, a Discomon swoops down on you from a nearby fine and prepares to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon

You feel as if you've reached the core of the planet.
Your path is obstructed by a large mass of tentacles, blocking your way forward.
A tentacle lashes out at you and just misses.
You look up above and realize that Fliipermon's are controlling them!
You can see blue essence sitting next to them.
< Back off and go home or take the Discomon on?
> Back off and go home
Your sensors commend you for your decision as you faced certain defeat. They drop a bit of blue essence they managed to steal from the Discomon in the process into your lap.

You head Southeast towards the salt flats. You can smell the salt in the air through your air ventilation as the air is nearly breathable.
Your can hear the crackle of your feet crushing the fragile salt footing beneath them. Your sensors tell you that this is likely Magnesium Sulfate.
Suddenly, the sand next to you begins to shake! A Discomon pushes its way upwards through the sand looking for a battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon
> Battle the Discomon and win
You regain yourself after the battle and ask yourself if you should continue.
< Do you want to continue on this path or head home?
> Continue on this path
You continue deeper on your path into the salt flats. You start to grow weary of the oppressive heat your suit is working so hard to prevent you from noticing.
The yellowish scenery here and the blue star illuminating it create a purplish horizon that seems to extend forever.
You scan the area with your suit's sensors but find no trace of anything living. However, you do find a hole in the ground nearby and decide to investigate it.
You shine a flashlight down the hole but see nothing but darkness. You shine your headlamp further in but can't see the bottom.
Dismayed by your useless foray into digging, you look up to continue on, but as you do so, your eyes meet the gaze of a Discomon staring at you menacingly and prepared for a battle.

Every now and then you see more Discomons passing you by beneath the surface.
You walk even faster to reach your destination soon...
You arrive at the blue light unperturbed.
An island surrounded by a glowing blue shield.
A series of complicated figures that resemble the ancient language are inscribed on each of the islands four sides.
You attempt to interface with the complex patterns but nothing happens.
The patterns are glowing, vivid and beautiful however.

Your ship starts to shudder violently, as if caught in an invisible vice. You see an enormous ring made up of solid ice and rock debris, surrounding the planet.
Your ship manages to stabilize itself and it only reports minor damage.
After this is resolved, you notice for the first time that the planet is primarily a vibrant yellow colour.

At first you're concerned that your ship incorrectly identified this planet as one with solid ground, as it seems to go on forever.

Lakes of liquid ethane dot the landscape to your Southeast. To your North is what appears to be an endless sea of red sands

You see what appears to be a never-ending dust storm to the North, and decide to approach it carefully.
Unfortunately, as you get closer, the dust storm begins to look more and more like a blood rain. Not able to approach any closer, you sit back and watch as the entire landscape is covered in red.
You wait for the storm to subside and then continue onwards into the red sand desert.
Your ship's sensors start beeping, and you see a new mass in the distance.
This new object speeds up towards you, and as it approaches you realize it's a Discomon!

< Choose planet for your quest or find a new solar system?
> Visit this planet
Not wishing to stay in orbit around a planet you know nothing about, you fly your ship closer to gather additional information.
Your sensors detect significant volcanism in the world below.
Its report paints the picture of a world of vast yellow deserts, separated by volcanically active mountains.
It plots a good landing spots for both a volcano to the North and sand deserts to the South.
< Do you want to visit the volcanoes or the sand desert?
> Visit the sand desert
You decide to head to the desert, flying your shuttle closer to the surface than you did before.
Your sensors can now easily detect lifeforms on the planet, even before you enter visual range.
You land at the predetermined spot in the sand desert.
Over the horizon you can see a sandstorm picking up steam and heading towards you.
Your sensors are not able to identify the intensity of it and because of that, are not sure if your exo-suit will be able to survive them.
< Find a new landing spot, head home early or try to make it through the sandstorm?
> Find a new landing spot
You decide to try to find a new landing spot.
Your ship takes off upwards. You soon realize that the sandstorm has engulfed the entire planet and that there is nowhere else to land the ship!
> Head home early
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship accelerates in reverse gradually over half a lightyear to save energy and reduce your cryosleep sickness.
You enter the orbit of the fourth moon of a gas giant of a blue hyper-giant main sequence star. This is a harsh planet that barely meets your criteria..
The planet below you appears to be covered in dense Jungle and looks like a healthy and fortified world.
< Explore moon or find a new solar system?
> Land on moon
You decide to Land on moon.
As your ship enters the planet's atmosphere, you can see a large area of the Jungle that is dominated by blue rivers, mostly made of water.
The planet is extremely life-sustaining and must have an extensive eco-system.
Although, many of the intelligent animals are violent and tend to attack other creatures on sight.
Your ship finds a clearing at the edge of the river systems and the jungle.
< Do you want to explore the river systems or explore the jungle?
> Explore the river systems
The river is one of the largest you've ever seen, perhaps with a width of twenty meters and a depth of eight meters. You almost get the urge to go for a swim.
Although, there are more important matters at hand.
There is strange, rich vegetation along the river and thick, dense Jungle otherwise. However, the ground is relatively flat and clear of large trees and plants.
The water of the river you're following has reacted strangely with your sensors; it is picking up an minor life-form reading but you can't see what it is detecting.
The river next to you parts and a Discomon emerges from the depths.
It rides the wake it created to the shore and lands in front of you ready for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You travel along the river and find a rather large stack of uprooted trees floating in one of the channels.
Intrigued, you order your ship to land on top of the flotilla so you can go out and investigate.
The other channel contains fractured tree trunks and branches.
You make a note of this, so you know not to go too far right or left of the rivers when travelling around it later.
A Discomon challenges you to a battle in the same fashion as the last one did!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You enter the orbit of the fourth moon of a gas giant of a neutron star. This is an ideal planet for sustaining Discomon..
The planet below you has a brilliant red colour to it and your sensors inform you that it's likely to be too hot to survive in normal conditions. Luckily, however, your exo-suit should be able to handle it for a long period of time.
There's a strong source of geothermal energy below as well as possible non-sentient life and your quest is to recover an essence of this world for preservation.
Your sensors inform you that the geothermal energy is a by-product of neutronium refinement. Neutronium is invaluable for the construction of starships that must endure unregulated hyperspace.
< Visit this moon or find a new solar system?
> Investigate moon
The hot springs glow with a red aura to them. You also see a strange structures on the surface of the moon. It appears as if they are of unnatural construction & likely ancient.
You find a small clearing in the hot springs and land your ship. You find a small clearing in the hot springs and land your ship. Exiting your ship, you see that the ground here is too warm and your heat shields are struggling to cope. You can hear a loud roar emanating from somewhere close by.
It's a good thing your hazard suit protects you from the intense heat. You take a look around, don't want to venture too far from the ship in case you need to make a quick escape.
Soon after your advance into the hot spring dotted landscape, a Discomon adapted to withstand the environment rides the plume of a hot spring and prepares for battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
Taking a look around, you see an abundance of plant life in every direction. This is augmented by the hot-springs surrounding you. The planet is very humid.
Up ahead is a range of small hills that dot the horizon to your North. Your sensors inform you that the strongest radiation readings it gets are coming from over these hills.
It is likely that the strange structures you noticed on your way down are in this direction.
You likely only have enough time before your exo-suit needs repair to fully investigate the hot springs, or head over these hills.
< Head North towards the small hills or continue exploring the hot springs?
> Continue exploring the hot springs
You decide to continue exploring the hot springs. You walk for hours through the hot springs without much of anything happening.
Their beauty is almost mesmerizing and you feel like you should turn back... but the signs on your suit's energy alarm are becoming more frequent.
Then without warning a Discomon ascends from the boiling water of one of the hot springs and prepares for battle!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You defeat the Discomon and collect yourself. Your exo-suit are approaching the danger zone and your sensors inform you that you should really be leaving.
You consider it, but notice a glimmering object just up ahead. It could be essence, but investigating it would be cutting it close for your exo-suit.
You could put your suit into emergency mode, which will elongate the exo-suit's effective lifetime, but this will make you more vulnerable to battle with wild Discomon,
you could risk it and hope you have enough time remaining, or you could just head home.
< Put your suit into emergency mode, risk it and investigate or head home?
> Risk it and investigate
You decide to risk it and investigate the glimmering object.
You approach the object and find a strange black box emitting a strange green glow and providing heat to the area around it.
You dare not get too close, as it feels warmer the closer you get.
You take a quick look and see strange markings on it as well as two buttons, a green one and a yellow one.
< Do you want to press the green button or the yellow one?
> Press the yellow button
A Discomon of great strength is materialized from a beam emitted from the strange black box.
It prepares to battle you!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your ship slows down and wakes you up from cryosleep. You've arrived at the eighth planet of a vast white hole solar system..
The planet below you has a distinct purple colour to it.
Your sensors inform you that this is likely because of the white hole at the center of this solar system constantly adding new matter to the system.
< Land on planet or find a new solar system?
> Choose planet for your quest
You decide to visit the mysterious purple world.
You arrive on the surface of the planet and are surprised by what you see: A massive, barren landscape with no signs of life whatsoever.
The terrain of the planet is desolate teal Tundra extending as far as the eye can see.
Curiously, however, the ground appears to be just a thin layer on the surface, and you can see what appears to be a vast purple cave subterranean cave network through many translucent patches.
You continue walking forward and come across a hole in the ground which looks like an entrance to the subterranean caves below.
< Ignore the caves and continue onwards across the tundra or explore the caves?
> Explore the caves?
You decide to explore the caves.
You drop into the hole and enter the cave system below.
The first thing you notice is how vividly purple they. The rocks shimmer emanate with purple luminescence.
Small plants dot the crevices and they look like something out of a fairy tale, like a night under the stars.
Your sensors inform you that it has detected a high concentration of Discomon signatures deeper in the cave.
< Do you wish to seek them out or head back to your ship?
> Seek them out
You decide to seek out the Discomon signatures.
You descend deeper into the cave.
Suddenly, you pick up 3 Discomon signatures in close vicinity to each other.
Do you want to approach them or avoid them?
< Do you wish to approach them out or head back to your ship?
> Approach them
As you come closer, you notice something is wrong with this Discomon: Its head is bloodied and it seems to be limping, dragging its hind legs behind it awkwardly.
Additionally, its signature is weak and erratic, almost feverish.
It charges you as it wants to battle!
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and win
You can see more arcane Discomon ascending from the depths of the cave.
Your sensors map the area for you and inform you that you can either try to cut the Discomon off deeper in the cave, or move towards the surface and wait for them.
< Do you want to try to cut the Discomon off or move towards the surface and wait?
> Try to cut them off
You move deeper into the cave and try to cut them off.
It appears to work. The first Discomon approaches and you prepare for battle.
< ⅰ You battle the Discomon!
> Battle the Discomon and lose
> End quest and leave with nothing.<|endoftext|>
